It's very, very attractive. If you have cash to put to work, you'd probably want to put it in the bill market or the front end of the bond market because your returns are going to be very, very high and safe.

2/7/2023,WLF,"Portfolio is definitely underweight equities, there's no doubt about it. So short term makes all kinds of sense.",Investments,Stocks
2/7/2023,WLF,"And the ten year peaked out on October 24. We went long duration on October 29, so we were five days late.",Investments,Bonds
2/7/2023,WLF,I'd be a little careful legging too far into the backside of yield curve.,Investments,Bonds
2/7/2023,WLF,We think the 10-Year trades between 340 and 390 for most of this year and back and forth. So I'd be a little careful here at the level we're at today.,Markets,Debt
2/7/2023,WLF,"If economic data keeps surprising to the upside, we have to price in more hikes. So good news, bad news.",Policy,Hiking Cycle
2/7/2023,WLF,"March rate hike is now basically a given, and then another 25 basis points in May, and it takes out any hope of cuts in the back half of the year.",Policy,Hiking Cycle
2/7/2023,WLF,"Earnings growth is just now turning negative. In the last 20-30 years, we've only seen that happen four times. Every time we've seen it happen, it ends up being a recession.",Corporate,Earnings
2/7/2023,WLF,You saw the Fed's senior loan survey. Financial conditions are tightening quickly.,Economy,Financial Conditions
2/7/2023,WLF,"So every time you think about a recession, you have three things that happen: You have interest rates have to go up, you have inflation spikes, and you have lending and conditions tighten.",Economy,Recession
2/7/2023,WLF,"The reality is the equity markets and the bond market have not believed the Fed up to this point. They just don't believe things like, the disinflationary process has started.",Markets,Equity
2/7/2023,WLF,So what the markets are missing is they keep using the inflation data on year over year.,Markets,Equity
2/7/2023,WLF,"So we're going to get there faster than what people think that's what we wrote in our 2023 economic outlook was, look, the great surprise this year is how fast inflation is going to come down.",Economy,Inflation
2/7/2023,RBC,"If we do go through a recession and the banks have been derisked because of the financial crisis and the stress test they go through every year, this will prove assuming they get through without having a major earnings problem. Assuming none of them cut their dividends, imagine what they're going to look like coming out of the next cycle if this all takes place.",Markets,Banks
2/7/2023,RBC,We could have a revaluation of banks coming out of this slowdown or recession as they become financial utilities assuming they don't blow up like they did in 08-09.,Markets,Banks
2/7/2023,RBC,"Last year in the second and third quarters, banks saw the biggest outflow of deposits on record going back to 1984.",Economy,Banks
2/7/2023,RBC,At what point do banks have to start attracting deposits with higher rates? It's really going to be the question in this high rate environment.,Economy,Banks
2/7/2023,RBC,"But we have to remind ourselves, if you go back to 2019, the system had just over $13 trillion of deposits and they were growing approximately 600 billion a year. Today the system is closer to $18 trillion because of QE. So I think you're going to see the continued outflow because of QE as now as QT.",Economy,Banks
2/7/2023,RBC,"But what's interesting is that the loan to deposit ratios are still very low. And so a normal loan to deposit ratio is over 90%, and the system today is under 70.",Economy,Banks
2/7/2023,RBC,"And one of the things that I find so amazing is Fed Funds rates have gone from zero to 25 basis points to 4 and 3 quarters, and there hasn't been any debacles yet. Nothing has blown up yet.",Economy,Interest Rates
2/7/2023,RBC,We do believe that loans to nondepository financial institutions could be the place where it blows up. Meaning loans to private equity companies. That's where the valuations have come down dramatically.,Markets,Banks
2/7/2023,RBC,"Anytime you have rapid loan growth in a specific asset class, that's where we take our nose to and we just haven't really seen it.",Markets,Banks
2/7/2023,RBC,"But there's cycles, as we all know, and there will be a capital market cycle. ECM will come back, IPOs will come back.",Markets,Banks
2/7/2023,VED,The current debt to GDP ratio is 124%.,Economy,GDP
2/7/2023,INV,But it seemed that the market took away the narrative that it wanted to find rather than really listening to what all of these central bank speakers gave us.,Policy,Hiking Cycle
2/7/2023,INV,"And I think if you look at the statements alone from all of these central banks, they lean hawkish.",Policy,Hiking Cycle
2/7/2023,INV,It seemed to shift to a singular focus on inflation versus before it's really been the dual mandate of inflation and we need to control the labor market.,Policy,Inflation
2/7/2023,INV,I think where I have trouble with the market's pricing and the market's narrative is about this turnaround easing in the second half of the year.,Policy,Hiking Cycle
2/7/2023,INV,"Even with a soft landing, if the Fed navigates a soft landing, there's not a real aggressive case for them to ease.",Policy,Economy
2/7/2023,INV,"Credit has rallied so hard, at least has talked about what's happened at investment grade, further down the quality spectrum to high yield as well.",Markets,Debt
2/7/2023,INV,"We've done a lot of work to reprice off of the extreme richness in the treasury market, but I don't think it's a duration trade as much from here.",Markets,Debt
2/7/2023,INV,"The underlying health of the corporate sector remains strong, and global growth, if we take a step back, looks a lot better than we thought we would be six months ago.",Corporate,Growth
2/7/2023,INV,"Six months ago, in the summer, we were talking about a massive energy crisis in Europe and a very deep recession. European growth has continued to beat impressed to the upside. China reopening has come to the table sooner than we expected. So I think that there's a lot of positive momentum.",Economy,China
2/7/2023,INV,"Credit is less appealing of the options for us. Duration trade worked well over last few months, but that's kind of over for now.",Investments,Bonds
2/7/2023,INV,Duration isn't so compelling here. I think it's more of a curve trade.,Investments,Bonds
2/7/2023,INV,I don't think that an inverted curve is sustainable in the long run.,Investments,Bonds
2/6/2023,RBC,I think there was a view that emerged over the weekend in Friday trading that the Fed may have to stay higher for longer.,Policy,Hiking Cycle
2/6/2023,RBC,I'm still in the camp that thinks we are closer to the end of this hiking cycle and we're going to get the pause.,Policy,Hiking Cycle
2/6/2023,RBC,"And for me, it really underscores the idea that this economy is very resilient.",Economy,Growth
2/6/2023,RBC,I think there could have been some labor hoarding.,Economy,Labor
2/6/2023,RBC,"But I think we just see this time and time again just evidence that the labor market is tight and that we are seeing if you look at some other reports, we're seeing some indications that wage growth is slowing. I think that's probably enough to help inflation come down.",Economy,Labor
2/6/2023,RBC,Roll-ups in small midcap space are potential catalysts for markets going forward and argues against the deeply bearish narrative in markets.,Corporate,M&A
2/6/2023,RBC,So one of the things we know about small cap companies is the quality is higher than it used to be.,Corporate,M&A
2/6/2023,RBC,"What we also know is that the price we're going to pay for either skirting the recession or a short shallow recession or a growth scare or whatever we end up calling this, is probably going to be that economic growth is subpar for a little bit in percentage terms.",Economy,Growth
2/6/2023,RBC,"Companies who have a lot of cash still sitting on their balance sheets, who have very good structures in terms of their debt profiles, will go out and buy some growth. And when you're looking at historically cheap valuations in small relative to large, it's something that simply makes sense.",Corporate,M&A
2/6/2023,RBC,If we're going back to rates we saw in the 70s of course that's going to slaughter PE multiples.,Markets,Equity
2/6/2023,RBC,We do have a couple of cuts baked in for the Fed at year end and it gets us to a 22x multiple.,Markets,Equity
2/6/2023,RBC,We also have the 10-Year Treasury at around 3.4% and inflation moderating to around 3%.,Economy,Inflation
2/6/2023,RBC,"So don't bake any cuts and keep that higher for longer. I'm still looking at a 20 plus PE multiple on a trailing basis on this year's earnings. So it hurts a little bit, but it doesn't hurt as much as people think if you go in and do the math.",Markets,Equity
2/6/2023,RBC,"Huge interest in China reopening thesis, but I think investors came into 2023 just wanting to do something new.",Investments,Stocks
2/6/2023,RBC,I think raising the geopolitical angst and talking about worsening relations between China and the US complicates the ability to play that trade.,Investments,Stocks
2/6/2023,RBC,China and US geopolitics is a more legitimate downside catalyst than earnings need to come down a little bit more.,Markets,China

2/6/2023,MAM,"I don't think the sort of what we would call the sort of old economy has really been devastated by interest rates. I think the problem is much more in people who have been very creative with financial engineering attached to a business, which is a lot of a sort of Private Equity / Venture Capital portion of the economy there.",Economy,Interest Rates

2/6/2023,MAM,"I think that we might be in this really weird situation that an index like the S&P 500 Equal might have finished its bear market last year, but the index we actually follow, which is the headline index, which is dominated by large cap tech, I think is still in the bear market.",Markets,Equity

2/6/2023,STC,"And if we look back at what happened in the US and what happened in Europe in the immediate aftermath of the first Pandemic wave, helped of course by a lot of government spending, particularly in the US. There was a huge surge, 25% real terms increase in consumer spending from trough to peak in the first twelve months after that first Pandemic wave in the US. Around 15% in Europe. And I think we're going to see similarly large increases in spending that's going to drive the Chinese economy forward.",Economy,China
2/6/2023,STC,"Our own view is that the sort of growth we're going to see in China is not necessarily going to be driving commodity prices substantially higher. It's not going to be construction led, it's not going to be investment led, very much a consumer led and probably consumer services led boom.",Economy,China
