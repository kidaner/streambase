I think there was a view that emerged over the weekend in Friday trading that the Fed may have to stay higher for longer.
I'm still in the camp that thinks we are closer to the end of this hiking cycle and we're going to get the pause.
"And for me, it really underscores the idea that this economy is very resilient."
I think there could have been some labor hoarding.
"But I think we just see this time and time again just evidence that the labor market is tight and that we are seeing if you look at some other reports, we're seeing some indications that wage growth is slowing. I think that's probably enough to help inflation come down."
Roll-ups in small midcap space are potential catalysts for markets going forward and argues against the deeply bearish narrative in markets.
So one of the things we know about small cap companies is the quality is higher than it used to be.
"What we also know is that the price we're going to pay for either skirting the recession or a short shallow recession or a growth scare or whatever we end up calling this, is probably going to be that economic growth is subpar for a little bit in percentage terms."
"Companies who have a lot of cash still sitting on their balance sheets, who have very good structures in terms of their debt profiles, will go out and buy some growth. And when you're looking at historically cheap valuations in small relative to large, it's something that simply makes sense."
If we're going back to rates we saw in the 70s of course that's going to slaughter PE multiples.
We do have a couple of cuts baked in for the Fed at year end and it gets us to a 22x multiple.
We also have the 10-Year Treasury at around 3.4% and inflation moderating to around 3%.
"So don't bake any cuts and keep that higher for longer. I'm still looking at a 20 plus PE multiple on a trailing basis on this year's earnings. So it hurts a little bit, but it doesn't hurt as much as people think if you go in and do the math."
"Huge interest in China reopening thesis, but I think investors came into 2023 just wanting to do something new."
I think raising the geopolitical angst and talking about worsening relations between China and the US complicates the ability to play that trade.
China and US geopolitics is a more legitimate downside catalyst than earnings need to come down a little bit more.
"517,000 jobs number was strong. I do think it's one of those reports that looks like a bit of a statistical aberration."
We're now back to where money costs something.
"The question is, are you operating in a kind of business that can generate enough cash flow, that rates at 5% is unimportant? I think for a lot of the economy, it's really still okay."
"I don't think the sort of what we would call the sort of old economy has really been devastated by interest rates. I think the problem is much more in people who have been very creative with financial engineering attached to a business, which is a lot of a sort of Private Equity / Venture Capital portion of the economy there."
We're going to be around 5% until things start to fall apart.
China thesis has changed positively since they switched to a more manageable COVID policy and have gone loose monetarily. But the geopolitical aggravation is not fun.
I think some of the markets surrounding China are investable. So I think Asia and the portions of the US market that feed into that are suddenly doing quite a lot better.
FTSE made an all time high on Friday record no one's talking.
"So I think for a portion of global, economically sensitive equities the news has got materially better in the last four months."
"I think it's really hard to decipher the signal from the noise, particularly short covering and some of the volatility. Some of the technicians I respect think they've seen enough to call this a new bull market. I don't."
I think that the change in monetary policy last year still matters.
"I think that we might be in this really weird situation that an index like the S&P 500 Equal might have finished its bear market last year, but the index we actually follow, which is the headline index, which is dominated by large cap tech, I think is still in the bear market."
"I don't think the Nasdaq 100 is going to make a new high in 2023 because I think it was grotesquely overvalued when it did make its all time high and I think these sort of ten year bull markets when they end, take a long time to give you a new high it doesn't happen in ten months."
"Weakness in crude oil prices since last summer was caused partly by what was going on in China, which we assume is getting better, but it was also caused by massive releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve."
Analysts continue to turn bullish … 30-day moving average of number of S&P 500 members with higher analyst target prices has climbed to highest since August 2021.
China story is pretty hopeful really. We're looking for growth of 5.8%. We're pretty confident that we're going to see a real surge in consumer spending.
"And if we look back at what happened in the US and what happened in Europe in the immediate aftermath of the first Pandemic wave, helped of course by a lot of government spending, particularly in the US. There was a huge surge, 25% real terms increase in consumer spending from trough to peak in the first twelve months after that first Pandemic wave in the US. Around 15% in Europe. And I think we're going to see similarly large increases in spending that's going to drive the Chinese economy forward."
"Our own view is that the sort of growth we're going to see in China is not necessarily going to be driving commodity prices substantially higher. It's not going to be construction led, it's not going to be investment led, very much a consumer led and probably consumer services led boom."
There is a lot of dissonance between the strong labor markets that we see and this disinflationary push.
"But some concern that with the unemployment rate as low as it is, the lowest on record, that it's only a matter of time before you see wages catching up."
"The work week was up, the employment was strong, whichever measure, and even if you account for seasonal adjustments and the sort of population increase, it's difficult to poke a hole in that data."
It was a shock so many people got the jobs number wrong.
"So, clearly, second half of last year GDP growth was strong, but if you look at the real spending data, then they were weak for October, November, December, the surveys showing activity, pretty sluggish."
We have had the courage to be bearish for all of 2022.
Dichotomy of Powell concerned about the economy overheating and Biden touting job growth.
"Subtle changes since the Fed meeting: 2-Year Treasury move, dollar has reversed, gold has come down."
"You have a different message right now on the equity market between technicals and fundamentals. So there's only two themes that have driven this entire rally at the beginning of the year long duration assets and low quality. It's all the things you don't want to own basically, that were just either some form of a January effect, some form of short covering, or some form of just reversion to the mean after tax law selling. That's not really the basis for a good sustainable rally from here right now."
The bottom line is you need the courage to buy quality right now. Quality is everything that wasn't this rally at the beginning of the year.
"You coiled the 50 day, 20 day and 200 day moving averages into a tight band that had to break out one way or the other. They broke to the upside here in the short term, but all near term indications suggest you're probably overbought at this level. So we would fade this latest rally."
"We still think it's probably a bear market rally, a la four or five of them in 2022 and probably fails into resistance and eventually comes back down before you move higher."
"The rally is giving you a second chance, you know, to unwind that lower quality if you want to, or you just reduce your equity positions. You take your risk budgets down in portfolios if you don't have them where you want to be. And then you hold that dry powder to your point of you're getting paid handsomely on the short side of the yield curve."
And you're actually for the first time in a long time getting positive real rates. So that gives you some nice carry while you wait out as this thing kind of the fundamentals catch up.
"Portfolio is definitely underweight equities, there's no doubt about it. So short term makes all kinds of sense."
"And the ten year peaked out on October 24. We went long duration on October 29, so we were five days late."
I'd be a little careful legging too far into the backside of yield curve.
We think the 10-Year trades between 340 and 390 for most of this year and back and forth. So I'd be a little careful here at the level we're at today.
"If economic data keeps surprising to the upside, we have to price in more hikes. So good news, bad news."
"March rate hike is now basically a given, and then another 25 basis points in May, and it takes out any hope of cuts in the back half of the year."
"Earnings growth is just now turning negative. In the last 20-30 years, we've only seen that happen four times. Every time we've seen it happen, it ends up being a recession."
You saw the Fed's senior loan survey. Financial conditions are tightening quickly.
"So every time you think about a recession, you have three things that happen: You have interest rates have to go up, you have inflation spikes, and you have lending and conditions tighten."
"The reality is the equity markets and the bond market have not believed the Fed up to this point. They just don't believe things like, the disinflationary process has started."
So what the markets are missing is they keep using the inflation data on year over year.
"So we're going to get there faster than what people think that's what we wrote in our 2023 economic outlook was, look, the great surprise this year is how fast inflation is going to come down."
"If we do go through a recession and the banks have been derisked because of the financial crisis and the stress test they go through every year, this will prove assuming they get through without having a major earnings problem. Assuming none of them cut their dividends, imagine what they're going to look like coming out of the next cycle if this all takes place."
We could have a revaluation of banks coming out of this slowdown or recession as they become financial utilities assuming they don't blow up like they did in 08-09.
"Last year in the second and third quarters, banks saw the biggest outflow of deposits on record going back to 1984."
At what point do banks have to start attracting deposits with higher rates? It's really going to be the question in this high rate environment.
"But we have to remind ourselves, if you go back to 2019, the system had just over $13 trillion of deposits and they were growing approximately 600 billion a year. Today the system is closer to $18 trillion because of QE. So I think you're going to see the continued outflow because of QE as now as QT."
"But what's interesting is that the loan to deposit ratios are still very low. And so a normal loan to deposit ratio is over 90%, and the system today is under 70."
"And one of the things that I find so amazing is Fed Funds rates have gone from zero to 25 basis points to 4 and 3 quarters, and there hasn't been any debacles yet. Nothing has blown up yet."
We do believe that loans to nondepository financial institutions could be the place where it blows up. Meaning loans to private equity companies. That's where the valuations have come down dramatically.
"Anytime you have rapid loan growth in a specific asset class, that's where we take our nose to and we just haven't really seen it."
"But there's cycles, as we all know, and there will be a capital market cycle. ECM will come back, IPOs will come back."
The current debt to GDP ratio is 124%.
But it seemed that the market took away the narrative that it wanted to find rather than really listening to what all of these central bank speakers gave us.
"And I think if you look at the statements alone from all of these central banks, they lean hawkish."
It seemed to shift to a singular focus on inflation versus before it's really been the dual mandate of inflation and we need to control the labor market.
I think where I have trouble with the market's pricing and the market's narrative is about this turnaround easing in the second half of the year.
"Even with a soft landing, if the Fed navigates a soft landing, there's not a real aggressive case for them to ease."
"Credit has rallied so hard, at least has talked about what's happened at investment grade, further down the quality spectrum to high yield as well."
"We've done a lot of work to reprice off of the extreme richness in the treasury market, but I don't think it's a duration trade as much from here."
"The underlying health of the corporate sector remains strong, and global growth, if we take a step back, looks a lot better than we thought we would be six months ago."
"Six months ago, in the summer, we were talking about a massive energy crisis in Europe and a very deep recession. European growth has continued to beat impressed to the upside. China reopening has come to the table sooner than we expected. So I think that there's a lot of positive momentum."
"Credit is less appealing of the options for us. Duration trade worked well over last few months, but that's kind of over for now."
Duration isn't so compelling here. I think it's more of a curve trade.
I don't think that an inverted curve is sustainable in the long run.
And any disagreement between the market and the Fed will be resolved by the economic data.
"We had a very strong employment report, and the market is now repriced to basically mimic what the Fed is written down in their December summary of economic projections."
"Well, I think part of the problem is debates and muddled is that people have either put themselves in the transitory camp or the non transitory camp and the reality is we have some of those in the transitory side."
"We had a lot of goods pressure inflation in the goods market sector of the economy because of the shifting composition of demand towards goods during the Pandemic. That's all unwinding now, but we still have quite a bit of pressure in services inflation."
We need to get services inflation ex housing down. We're not going to do that until we have more slack in the labor market.
The labor market is basically the tightest labor market in memory and that is not consistent with a 2% inflation outturn.
"So the Federal Reserve needs to push the unemployment rate up, generate more slack in the labor market, take wage inflation down."
Financial conditions are sort of the way that monetary policy impulse gets translated to the real economy.
So it's really important that the rise in short term rates affects bond prices and stock prices.
"It's a rise in long term interest rates, the rise in mortgage rates that's really cooled off housing."
"I think Paul basically is not that disturbed by the marginal easing and financial conditions we've had over the last few months because he knows that if the Fed keeps going, financial conditions probably won't ease much further and the Fed wizard will actually be able to get control of things."
As long as that they're in restrictive territory that will slow the economy and bring inflation down.
"I think if they are faced with stronger data, I think it's more likely that they extend the timing of how long monetary policy is restrictive as opposed to keep raising the rate higher and higher."
"Now obviously, if the economy stays really strong, then they're going to revise up their forecast of what interest rate peak is necessary to slow the economy."
"The economy just has too much forward momentum to go into recession anytime soon. However, it is likely in the medium term."
"And every time the Fed has pushed the unemployment rate up by more than half a percentage point, we've always ended up in recession."
"So I think the financial system is stronger now, the banking system is in much better shape, much more capital, much more liquidity stress test, risk management. That's why the Federal Reserve is in some way in control of the process."
"And I think that's what is difficult in analyzing this economy, that we had such big movements during the Pandemic period, big increases in savings built up. And we're trying to figure out now, as those things are moving in the opposite direction, savings, for instance, are coming down, how much of a tailwind that's going to be for demand and for spending and for price pressure. And going back to that jobs report, it looks like we may have more of a tailwind than we might have thought."
"But if you look at those non shelter services, you look at services away from housing, those are still inflating at a rate of about 4% annualized."
"So it does look like maybe some of the biggest, most aggressive inflation on the good side has come off, but we still have the services inflation, and that's what's going to be sensitive to the labor market."
"But even 300,000 jobs a month would be enough to keep that unemployment rate moving down. It's already at a 50 year low."
"It's hard to think that the strong labor market wouldn't create wage pressure, but we are seeing wage pressure actually decline."
"One of the most interesting things in the data that we have this really tight labor market that's actually tightening further, and then across a range of measures we saw some softening in wages."
"The March meeting is going to be really important because that's where Chair Powell isn't going to be able to do what he did in the interview yesterday and kind of say, well, let's let the data take us where it does. The FOMC will have to come out, and Fed officials broadly will have to come out with their projections for the economy, inflation, and importantly, for that terminal policy rate."
"We've been cautioning against the fact that we think that this is yet another bear market rally, that if we were going to really materialize the soft landing, we would not be seeing negative earnings and year over year compares and not negative earnings guidance and negative earnings revisions."
So I'm heartened that maybe our clients are taking our cautionary view to heart.
"They're also embracing for the first time, and would literally six, seven, eight years, a livable fixed income yield, meaning net of the expected inflation by the end of the year, which may be sub 4%, give them a positive real yield, and they don't need to take any duration risk."
"So we've got folks piling into things like certificates of deposit, like money market funds, which I know in many eras we're not considered sexy products, but are satisfactory for a lot of investors right now."
"The problem is, right now we've got an inverted yield curve, and so you're not really getting paid any extra yield for taking on some of that duration risk."
"The US equity market is fighting the Fed big time. There are some major disconnects in how the equity market is positioning itself. We saw a huge short covering rally. We saw a low quality dimension to the rally. And now most recently, we've seen cyclicals outperforming more defensive stocks. What's precarious about cyclical stocks performing is that we have almost all the cyclical linked indicators, meaning recession linked indicators, like the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which has really plummeted, and yet it's disconnected from this cyclical outperformance."
There are these things called zero day to expiry options at the index level. It's getting a ton of attention. It has become an important marginal price setter.
Look at options volumes yesterday dominated by zero and one day to expiry SPY options. Higher rates have caused this unintended consequence as people have moved out of 0% money market funds deposited to places where they can get 4% interest and take 10% of their capital and trade options virtually for free every day.
"I do think that we're in a period of time where there are some of the speculative excesses going on. And right now, this issue of excess liquidity in markets of huge piles of cash still sitting on the sideline, it is there. This use of options and this willingness to take these kind of very high turnover strategies and to me that's an indication that liquidity is at play, that market stability will be raised again as an issue."
"And while Chair Powell did not want to address the realities of the fact that over the last four months financial conditions have massively eased, he has not answered the question."
"The reality is we're seeing these bizarre perturbations in markets, this speculative activity."
"We've labeled this the third act of streaming. Your conversations today about the cost of money will affect this. Shocking how little cash they produce, even Walt Disney. So they have to use the next one or two years to consolidate, slow down content, spend rates, pricing. They need to change the dimension of their business quickly."
"For years we were talking about content is king. You're willing to borrow whatever kind of money you need to, to invest in whatever kind of production you need to."
Platform is king is the new mantra after content is king. You have to have a scaled platform distribution platform. You need to get the critical mass of enough people with a minimum amount of churn. There's a lot of average content that's sticky just because you have this scaled base where people come in every day to take a look at something.
"Netflix has this constant shooting model where they basically putting shots on goal every day. The media industries don't have a model like that. They pick their franchises, they build them, they let them out slowly. Netflix has a model that's really hard to replicate. But these companies can't get there because their balance sheets are too restrictive."
But I think you're going to see everyone start driving higher and higher revenues through pricing and advertising and then also using windowing to try to offload the cost of the content in older window.
Followed this discipline and mantra of purchase price matters.
Companies are much more focused on returning capital to shareholders.
"We're not in that zero cost of capital world anymore. What's going on at the big oil majors, what's going on at Disney, what's going on a lot of other companies, these companies now are very focused on cash flow generation."
"I see a big downshift in inventory dynamics, and hence quite a good probability of a shockingly low negative GDP number for the first quarter and probably for the second quarter as well."
"So the NBER defines recession in much more broad terms. It's all about falling output, falling incomes, falling employment. I don't think we're going to get that."
"The market shorthand for recession, of course, is two quarters of falling GDP and I think there's a very good chance that we get that."
"So the Fed is hammering away with rates, but the private sector's debt service costs are still very low, their balance sheets are pretty strong, savings build up is still there for some people anyway, and so there's quite a lot of protection against what the Fed is doing."
We can get the sustained disinflation that we need without a recession if wage growth doesn't spiral.
"We also see supply chain challenges, and then also the energy transition is going to keep some upward pressure on inflation, so we expect it to keep coming down in the near term."
"And if you look at production and supervisory workers, the slowdown in wage growth from last year into this year is even more encouraging."
"We know that employers are dealing with higher borrowing costs, a little bit of softening in demand."
"If companies get spooked and those higher borrowing costs hit their capex and their hiring decisions, well, that's going to lead to recession. I actually think it's going to have a lot more to do with the lagged effects and all of the hikes that were last year much more important than whether the Fed stops at five or 5."
Businesses are reevaluating those CAPEX decisions.
"We know that residential investment has been hit very hard and this is exactly what they're trying to do, is to engineer that slowdown in the economy."
We saw emerging markets get devastated last year during Federal Reserve hiking cycle with the dollar appreciating in value. It is the darling this year as it seems the Fed is maybe going to stop pretty soon. I think that the momentum could carry us higher for the next month but I still think it's a bit early to jump into that trade.
"Everyone's jazzed about the China reopening trade, and that's fantastic for emerging markets."
A weakening dollar is very favorable for emerging markets.
Economic growth this year is going to be stellar in emerging markets.
"I think US recession is not priced, particularly in the equity markets, and we have not seen difficulties with financing. There's a lot of names in the emerging space as well as in high yield that have not had those financing difficulties that I do expect to come to the fore as we feel the repercussions and the ramifications of 500 basis points and tightening in more than a year."
We're in for probably a ten year cycle of going back to what I'll call normalized interest rates.
"Getting harder to cash in and more important, to do the due diligence of building up right now at a time when the IPO market hasn't fully recovered."
"Because fundamentally, what private equity is trying to do is inject capital, in businesses, and then grow them."
You just have to become more selective and more fundamental.
"When they broke Glass Steagall and changed all the rules, banks have had to be much more conservative."
"And large private equity firms are becoming more like the merchant banks of the old and branching out into debt services, branching out into selling and buying of companies."
"In the last five to ten years, as we've talked, there was a speculative bubble where people believe that everything could be Amazon, that the weight of money and putting money into growth capital. Companies would gain share and you could lose money for a long period of time. When money is cheap, you probably can do that."
"And when you change interest rates, the value plummets. And you've seen that now in the tech market. So I think we're going to go back to the future."
But you have to kind of go back to fundamentals and have companies that gain share and become profitable because you can't take the strategy of losing money for five to ten to 15 years to then create a great business at the end.
Over the past decade we were talking about companies that would borrow money to pay their stockholders.
Every guest coming on and saying duration has been overbid and perhaps you want to fade that a little bit and you're seeing that on the margins.
Volatility coming down has always been supportive of risk assets.
"We've had a very strong rally in January, probably gone a little bit too far coming from two things: I think its portfolio managers were under positioned in risk at year end plus we're seeing more economic strength than we expected."
Corporate balance sheets still have some decent cash.
Any treasurer who didn't foresee this recession ought to be taken out and shot because it's been so well advanced.
"Retail money is flowing into high yield. Institutional money is flowing into high yield again. I think it's a repositioning from being way short at year end, but that window can shut fairly quickly."
This is a credit market that's almost a little bit frothy.
The weaker dollar trend that started in the fourth quarter really spurring this risk on rally.
Revenue growth was the major driver of earnings. But now we're hearing more about margin pressure.
Buybacks are sort of back in the narrative.
"So we think this is going to be a tough environment for companies going forward. Costs are elevated, especially the cost of capital having risen a lot that is yet to be absorbed, and top line growth slowing meaningfully as consumers start to retrench."
This year's rally is not based on fundamentals.
I'm wondering about the messaging around an active portfolio about whether this is about avoiding losses or about whether this is delivering outsized gains and what that tells us about where the sentiment on the risk reward continuum really has shifted.
"Yeah, to us, it's all about risk management in this environment."
"So we would be careful about reaching for the riskier corners or pockets of the market here, and we would be redeploying assets in higher quality, more defensive areas."
"With the Fed lowering rates to zero and keeping them there, you were essentially paid to take risk. And so people invested in growth stocks, largely technology stocks. And within technology stocks, the stock that did even the best were those with large revenue growth but negative earnings."
"But assuming you take Powell at his word, and he leaves rates up there, then I think the days of just investing in growth stocks and in hyper growth stocks is over now."
The rally we've seen here today is somewhat of a last hurrah.
Next new paradigm of investing could go to a more diversified portfolio. Maybe it goes a lot more to infrastructure related companies.
"I don't think tech will be dead, but it'll be more focused on companies with actual earnings"
"People will focus on infrastructure companies, they'll be stock picking. That's where I think it'll go."
Inflation regime of the next couple of years will be higher stickier.
"The major reason why inflation has been low is that the supply chain of developed countries moved out to Asia, China, where the labor and the costs were much cheaper. What COVID proved to everyone was that while that supply chain was cheap, it was also incredibly brittle. So companies realize they can't have a brutal supply chain because it means that if something happens, they'll have no products."
When supply chain moves back it'll become resilient but prices will be higher.
"If there is a recession, it'll just be a run of the mill recession, not a calamity."
I don't see a crisis in the banks now.
"I want to go to a chapter in the Michael Lewis book, The Big Short, which was The Long Quiet. Some would say the long quiet was the artificiality of low, low real rates that we've seen for well in excess of ten years."
We return to a real rate environment.
"I think there's a possibility that inflation goes back up. I just sold my used car and had 85,000 miles on it, and I got a price I was shocked by."
"I'll tell you one thing that I've been doing lately, which I haven't done in 15 years. Our groups are actually buying bonds, at least some bonds. And when we have cash, we either park it in a money market fund that yields over 4%. Or we even buy three months Treasuries with a yield of 4.6%"
"So as long as rates stay high, the old paradigm of what was it called? TINA. There is no alternative. It's not true that there's no alternative."
"I mean, we tell our clients, you can have something a very short term duration with a yield of 4-5% with zero risk, they're happy to park some cash. Get paid to wait now, quite literally literally 5%? Yes, 5%."
"We've bought some minors very recently. It's partially an infrastructure story. If you look at a chart of those stocks, I don't think they've done anything in 20 years."
We have a much more diversified portfolio right now.
"There are a few financials, there's healthcare, there's some utilities, which is a story also of infrastructure."
"The days where somebody has 40% of their portfolio in tech, I think might be in the past."
I do think the age of speculation of that intensity is probably over.
"The like I said before, the high revenue growth companies with negative earnings got destroyed last year. They were down 75% to 90%."
"If inflation starts to come back and the Fed either raises rates more than people expect or keeps it there, people's taste for such speculation is going to erode. But like I said before, people don't give up paradigms easily. It takes time."
I think some people are guilty of becoming married to positions.
People have invested in tech stocks for a very long time. They love them. They're married to them. But I don't see being married to stocks.
Price is about as disconnected from reality as it's been during this bear market.
I think what we're seeing is that things are actually improving around the world.
"In terms of Europe, the way things are looking over there, the better than expected earnings so far."
"I think companies are doing their job to navigate a rough environment overall, and we have the Federal Reserve doing the job to end the period of free money and put us back on a more realistic course."
But fundamentals overcome momentum and high leverage.
"This is the trading and churning on the market. In the old days, we used to hold stocks for years. Now we hold them for months. We've gone from a five year hold to an average ten month hold."
"I think more than ever before, there really is a recognition that there are, you have two different types of investors: you've got the short term crowd and you've got the intermediate long term crowd. Short term evidence of fear and greed and longer term it's need and the realization that investing in innovation, in corporations that that know how to manage their products and their services."
Central banks going much further than they previously said they would seems like that's the preeminent concern among a growing number of investors right now.
"But we have to say the central banks are doing their job and are showing remarkable ability to essentially, if not pivot or pause, but to maintain a view that they're going to be vigilant against inflation."
I don't think any central banker around the world wants to be remembered as Arthur Burns is remembered.
"Uncertainty is part of life, and it certainly moves through the market"
"Our target is 4400 for the S&P this year. Our main concerns are on the day to day basis, the ability of the market to oversell as well as to overbuy in the near term."
You have to curb enthusiasm somewhat and keep a good business mind in terms of what you're investing in and your courage of your convictions.
I think the 2-Year is all about that endpoint of the hiking cycle. It's all going to come down to inflation.
"I think inflation and later on this year, I think it's going to come down to the labor market which is still strong."
"The Fed is not stopping yet. Two more 25s, I would say there's a decent chance of another 25 and then they pause again."
"I think it's going to depend on how quickly does that service inflation come down, which would allow them to start to cut rates."
So I think it's only when we get into that to handle 2.5-3% inflation sustained basis can the Fed start to make policy a little less restrictive.
"I think we are sufficient and restrictive, and I get a lot of pushback on that because the data is strong. But there are lags, long and variable lags. I think we're in that process of lags. The fact that the consumer has so much still accumulated savings has actually widened that lag period."
"I know markets price it in, but for the consumer to actually start to cut back on spending and I think they are starting to cut back."
"When those savings run out, in our view, that happens in the second half of the year, that's when the consumer starts to cut back."
"So I think policy is restrictive. Real rates, well north of 1%, is going to have an impact on the consumer. I think it just is going to take some time."
"I think the last two recessions have been shock led, which is why the market is just waiting for the data to fall apart. I think it's going to be a slow grind."
"It's like that last mile when you're running that marathon, just you slow down, it feels really long. I think we're in that moment of the market impatient. So that's why we're moving from hard landing, soft landing, no landing."
"I still think that interest rates, real interest rates, well north of that 50 basis point that we think is normal, that is restrictive. It just is taking a while for that to slow the US economy down."
"So I think what's going to be tricky is, as the economy starts to slow down, can the Fed respond? I don't think we're going to get any fiscal response, in fact, into the debt ceiling. We might actually get some spending cuts. What makes us more nervous about a hard landing is policy is restrictive."
"We wait for the Fed to stop QT to start to cut rates, and we think the inflation environment is going to prevent them from doing that. And so if policy remains restrictive for longer, that soft landing very quickly starts to look like a hard landing. Now, if we're lucky and inflation actually does start to come down, I think the Fed can respond and then we can perhaps get that soft landing."
I do think that yield curve inversion can go more deeper. I think we're getting to that attractive level.
We could perhaps get closer to 4% on the 10-Year. I think legging into duration now does start to make sense.
I would say terminal rate pricing is pretty fair.
"The rate cuts look a little bit early in our view, but I think they are going to have to cut rates next year."
I think you're getting to levels where duration risk is going to look more attractive than equity risk.
"This will be the most anticipated recession we'll have ever had if it materializes. Now it looks less likely to materialize than it did two months ago. But I still think it would be incredibly weird if we didn't get a downturn, given the aggressive rate pace of rate hikes.."
"The labor market has held up really well, and I wonder if that's to some degree a result of labor hoarding."
We don't really have a great way of measuring labor hoarding. It's mostly anecdotal rather than actual data. But I do think that labor hoarding could change on a dime.
"If companies feel like their earnings are starting to turn, rates continue to go higher, then I think they might figure, well, maybe we should lay these people off rather than trying to get through this rough period by keeping them on our balance sheet."
"And when the labor market declines, that's what will spark a recession."
"But instead we get a series of rolling recessions where you have manufacturing and contraction while services are expanding significantly. Then services come off, so you get contractions, recessions in individual sectors, just not all at the same time."
Given that there won't be one big shock that brings down the acceleration in prices and that you could still get growth in other areas that keep propping up pricing power. So I think that means that inflation will be difficult to bring down.
"Inflation is going to be a whole lot harder getting from 6% to 2% inflation. Particularly if we have parts of the economy that are remaining buoyant and so are providing demand, as the Fed is trying to lean against demand to bring it back into line with supply so that we stop getting an acceleration in prices."
"I also think it's worth thinking about what inflation looks like when the dust has finally settled on the Pandemic, on the war on supply chain disruptions."
"But I do think that if you believe that we lived in secular stagnation and that was driving low inflation, low rates, low growth, and it was based on an excess of global savings, we're all going to be spending a lot of money on defense, on the green transition that could fundamentally be moderately inflationary. At the end of the day, we could be deglobalizing."
I wish we had some metric for figuring out exactly what the lag is for monetary policy feeding through into the real economy.
But I will say that I think the markets have been mispricing the Fed for a while now.
So I think that Fed rates could get a bit higher than the markets are pricing. Markets are still pricing in cuts this year. I think that's unrealistic. I think the Fed will keep rates high through this year and maybe start to cut next year.
I don't think we'll be going into a recession in the first half of this year.
"So I think the recession will take a while, thanks partly to the huge cash buffer that companies and consumers have off the back of stimulus measures when the Pandemic hit."
"CPI print is about as expected. Inflation is normalizing, but it's coming down slowly."
"And I just think there's going to be a lot more persistence to inflation than maybe we'd all want. Part of that is still COVID factors, excess money in people's pockets, supply chain issues, businesses out there still trying to recover lost margin."
I'm hearing people still out there pushing price and trying to test where the levels of inelasticity really are.
One part of the puzzle is inflation coming down. The other part is actually hitting our target. And so it's going to take a while to get to there.
"I try not to get too wound up in any particular data read, particularly a January data read, large seasonality factors, all that sort of stuff."
"I do think the lesson of the 70s was very clear, which is don't give up too early. And anything I've read and I've talked to lots of other people who seem to have understood that market, they say if you go back to the Arthur Burns years, it was raise rates, economy weakens, lower rates, inflation comes back stronger."
"Outside of mortgage lending and tech, business actually remains pretty sound."
"And part of it is they really fought hard for 18 months to get workers, and they're really reluctant to shed workers if it turns out that they didn't need to."
"I do think we've seen in a number of sectors, particularly interest sensitive sectors, particularly sectors where the strength of the dollar matters, you've seen demand move very quickly."
"If you go in lots of other places, think healthcare for a second, a big part of the economy, it's not at all clear that the rate stuff we've done or are doing is having that much impact on demand."
"I think we may be looking at an economy more like the one that I remember back in the early 90s, where there was a tightening cycle and different sectors got hit one at a time. It seemed like much more of a rolling situation."
The place that's still screaming tight is skilled trades. We just don't have as many as we need.
We did a bunch of actions we thought important at the time in terms of stimulus and supporting the markets back in 2020. We're now trying to unwind that. Our primary tool is the rate tool not the balance sheet.
"The objective is to unwind the balance sheet expansion that we did and do it in a way that doesn't change any focus on our primary tool, which is the rate tool."
"I do believe that on both the expansion side and the reduction side, it's a lot smaller than some of the estimates you'll see and people talk about the impact of buying more bonds. There's also a signaling effect when you're buying."
I think the signaling effect may actually outweigh the impact of buying the bonds.
"Worries include the possibility of recession, Ukraine and energy prices, debt limit leading to default."
A trillion plus in excess savings still out there. The infrastructure bill is still being deployed.
I do think there's a lot of seasonal noise in the data we saw with the January employment report.
"I think the key here really is this housing piece. We're taking that out, it's over 40% of the core CPI."
But the broad point is that services prices tend to be very sticky and they've accelerated.
"They want to get rates just above 5%, which probably means two more quarter point hikes, and then they want to pause and give it a few months and see what happens."
"But my point being that some of these volatile categories that had been driving down the readings in late 2022 continued in January, and we still got a 4, that as long as shelter costs are going up as rapidly as they have been, it's going to be tough to get inflation down anywhere close to where the Fed would like to see it."
"And one thing I think people maybe aren't paying enough attention to is that when inflation comes down, don't be sure interest rates are going to come down as much as people got used to before 19 2022"
I think the next decade we're going to land at a higher real interest rate before.
"Well, we had lower financial conditions for longer for a long time because people were scared after the financial crisis. Saving was really high. Investment was really low. Now we've entered an era where debt has really gone up quite a bit, private and public, which leads to some adjustment in the interest rate."
"Basically, tighter financial conditions have been bad for markets, and yet an effective tightening has allowed markets to rally that much more. So higher real rates will mean lower asset prices in general."
"The real outcome if we have too much debt is that we'll get more inflation at some point. That's what just happened. We just had an effective partial default on debt. Inflation was much higher than anyone was expecting, and that put money in the government's pockets."
"Inflation is like a race between watching grass grow and paint dry, but it's clearly peaked."
I find the supercore fixation basically juvenile. The significant downdraft you're actually seeing in the core good CPI to me that is telling the tale.
"Virtually every real macro indicator was negative on a three month basis heading into the end of 2022. And then, bang, we get the non farm payroll number. And it influenced everybody's expectations."
"But we know that employment, like inflation, is a lagging indicator. It tells you nothing about the future."
What happened to ADP worst number in 23 months? It was 48 hours before non-farm payroll.
"Our view has been that there will be a recession in the US this year. It's clearly not going to start in the first quarter based on all the evidence we've gathered so far on sales, on employment trends."
"But on the other hand, surveys are still pointing to a recession coming in the US. Look at the PMIs. They're below 50 for both services and manufacturing. When you look at the survey of consumer expectations coming out of New York Fed last week, it is still pointing to downbeat expectations. So are the Michigan surveys. The conference board surveys."
Consumer spending is not necessarily a reflection of a positive mood. Inflation has a way of making people fear the future and they spend now. It's about the inflationary backdrop that you buy now because you're worried that prices go up later.
"Eventually you see your real wages erode, you see your real income erode because of inflation and you're forced to settle into a lower level of spending because of it, in real terms."
"But in the next few months you're going to start to see the US economy weaken and it's going to be in the context of a global economy that might actually continue to strengthen our view. For example, the dollar is predicated on that. We don't think that the weakness in the dollar is over in part because we see a more deeper recession coming in the US and North America generally than we do in the rest of the world."
We're as data dependent as ever seen.
Market is underestimating the amount of credit tightness there is in the US.
"If you look at the loan officer survey, if you look at the NFIB survey of small business lending, it is collapsing."
"It's at recessionary levels, at least with regard to things that are pertinent to the fed, the credit markets, things look recessionary or about to go into a recession in the US."
"One of the elements of luxury that always makes brands reinvent themselves. They have archives. You can go back and reinvent what was successful in the past with the twist of what's modern in today that appeals to younger consumers, that appeals to an international consumer."
"I think what was interesting about the January sales number is it was broad based very strong. You looked at apparel, you looked at furniture, they showed strength. Big uptick in restaurants."
"I don't take January as seriously as I take March, April and May. January is about clearing out promotional and clearance goods."
"You're hearing about retailers having inventory levels that were up 20 and 30% in the third quarter, and now they're down in the fourth quarter. You moved product, some of it at markdowns."
"Gasoline prices are lower, so people had more discretionary spending."
"People have been using their savings to live on, given the strength in essentials prices."
"So how sustainable is this, given the fact that some people are expecting that the savings will go down by the middle or the third quarter of this year."
I think these rates are extraordinarily high. I think that we will get more moderation as we go to March going forward.
The other thing we saw is the flip to physical stores.
"I've heard of some retailers, some categories, looking to maybe reduce prices by 5% or so from the increases they took last year."
Discretionary sales have moderated given inflationary pressures.
"The reality is food, rent, cars. All of this is incredibly expensive and really biting into the average American."
Companies like Walmart or the dollar store are seeing even more customers with high income households who are trading down.
"The trade down is real and that's what impacts, I think, the March go forward time period when inflationary pressures moderate."
"I've always learned price clears inventory once again, that's what happened."
They've expanded the categories in order to capture more wallet share while remaining competitive on price share.
I think in 2023 we have more clarity on margins than sales increases.
I like Ralph Lauren. I like Deckers.
I think that the no landing scenario is growing every day. And what is driving that is the labor market.
"The problem with the labor market is there is no problem with the labor market. And if there isn't a problem with the labor market, the Fed is not going to see a reason to pivot."
"The probability that the Fed raises rates in June to go to five and a half is now gone above 50%. And that's the first time I believe, this cycle that the market has actually gotten ahead of the Fed."
Services are not in disinflation. They look very sticky right now.
"40% of the rally in the equity markets is eight stocks. It's the FAANG stocks plus Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. It's 2021 all over again."
Earnings are going to come back that's bullish.
"The forward PE ratio, the PE ratio of what earnings are expected to be in the next year is 18 and a half. You're not paying a cheap multiple for this market, you're going to pay full for this market."
"Biggest concern going forward are variable lags, given we're seeing easier financial conditions."
"Here is the uncomfortable question of maybe the Fed is not at sufficiently restrictive. And that's all we've done in the last year has gone to neutral. That's why we're having a no landing, that's why the inflation rate is being so sticky and that we all assume."
Barely half of the offices in the United States are now occupied five days a week. Everybody's on some kind of range of remote work.
"Bank of America has put out a lot of statistics about balances in everybody's checking account and they're still very elevated. So a lot of the stimulus money that we saw handed out in 2020 and 2021, especially at the lower income levels, haven't been spent. And so these people still have spending power."
"I got to think the Federal Reserve, they look around and go, I don't see any reason to even think about pivot, let alone think about stopping raising rates."
"Look, we just hit 5% yesterday on the six month bill. That is the first treasury security to yield five in 15 years."
I could get six without taking any risk whatsoever by parking it in a treasury bill or a short term treasury security. That is going to prove to be a lot of competition for the idea that the stock market can continue to roar ahead.
Bond markets inversion that you're seeing in the 2-10 spread is somewhat indicative of what's to come with respect to recession and stocks. We could still be a year away from the recession and the yield curve will have worked as an indicator.
"And I think a lot of people are expecting that in a downturn it's going to be a road right back to zero on interest rates, and we might not see that this time around."
"If I was to look at it, I look at the more traditional Goldman Sachs type of indicators, and that says that they've eased a lot and then anecdotally with zero DTE options, with meme stocks like Bed Bath and Beyond doubling in a day with the FAANG stock starting to move. It seems like it's a very easy environment right now, and it is not a tight environment, and that should be concerning over at the Fed."
"So that's zero days to expiry options at the index level. Really short term stuff. What has happened is that they now list options every day, and they expire every day, and about half the volume is in options that will expire today. I think what it's done is it's created intraday volatility. So, you see, these big swings from yesterday was a great example of it. Right up 1%, down 1%, close around unchanged, day to day volatility."
I would say there's a massive bet on $100 barrel oil.
"Oil demand is expected to be strong, as it always we could drain and apparently we are going to drain the SPR because apparently it's a political slush fund."
Our electric vehicle usage is that in the short hydrocarbon world.
And we don't have a winter. So we have ideal driving conditions. And yet gasoline demand is still about 4% below a year ago. But we do have to factor out the fact that more people are driving hybrids.
This economy has a problem because gasoline demand is a tremendous economic leading indicator.
"The International Energy Agency put out this report this morning saying world oil supply looks set to exceed demand through the first half of 2023, but the ballots could quickly shift to deficit as demand recovers and some Russian output is shut in."
EVs are great but they're certainly not great for the environment. Ripping up earth to get heavy metals. It will make 100 years of coal mining and oil drilling look like a pin prick of the amount of environmental degradation.
"Consumer is out there able and willing to spend. And this speaks to the inflation data, it speaks to the labor market data that the consumer still has purchasing power."
Consumer of course has utilized savings and increased credit card usage.
"Good news on the disinflationary storyline is that the supply side has really come back. You've seen this, this repair of supply chains, you've seen the restocking of retailers."
"So inventory levels are back to normal and retailers have been able to return to just in time inventories, which makes pricing much easier, much more transparent."
During the holiday season we did see consumers enjoy a lot more promotions and discounts.
"Disinflationary story for services, particularly the supercore which takes out housing, it's going to be more tied to the labor market. And there, we know there's still some wage pressure, we know there's still a lot more stickiness. So that's just going to take time."
"If you think about the core goods components prior to the pandemic, those were deflationary components, they were seeing price reductions and then you have this dramatic increase in the level of prices which does not seem sustainable. So a mean reversion back to more normal levels or more of a disinflationary tendency for those categories seems right? And the labor market, we know, is not going to be able to continue at this rate forever."
"Every day now, they create options that expire either that day or the next day. People are really literally gambling and you can sit there. It's almost like watching a horse race. Volumes have exploded for as much as 40% of equity."
"Volumes can be related and tied back to the hedging of these single day options. So it's a very massive driver and I think it's why we're seeing moves just that are amplified. So maybe something that would be a half percent move based on the news becomes a one and a half to 2% move. And it's going in both directions, tends to exaggerate the price move."
"And I think it reminds me a lot of what we are seeing about a year and a half, two years ago where you kind of had those gamma squeezes and that was very much individual stocks."
VIX is kind of irrelevant to me. VIX only calculates options with 27 to 35 days of expiration as more and more people gravitate towards these daily options. To the roulette machine. Volatility doesn't get picked up in that. So I think that's where the surprises are going to come.
People are looking at VIX for the hedging. It's all occurring in this daily and weekly option.
"Options are derived out of four times leverage. Futures derive out a ten times leverage. With these short dated options, what is their leverage equivalent? It's got to be way higher."
"I think 0DTE really has started gravitating more and more towards not just retail traders, but institutional traders are gravitating to this. You're not getting these types of volumes because it's mom and pop or the kids playing. This has definitely hit the big institutional desk as a trading strategy."
"I think market position now turns on a dime. The ability to move huge amounts of risk through relatively short dated options, I think has changed that risk positioning. So it used to take weeks to a month for everyone to go from overbought to oversold. I think these things happen in days or weeks now."
"If it's like everything else, I think what we'll see is one down day where we go through some of the triggers that stop the exchanges, and then regulators will pay attention because no one ever pays that much attention when the bias tends to be higher."
"Last year was very driven by rate beta. The sensitivity of the stock market, particularly growth stocks, and even more than that, the early growth names to both nominal and real rates. We've seen this move higher in rates, and the Nasdaq is ripping."
You've had a reversal from really extreme positioning at the end of 2022. And that hasn't clearly ended yet. You had massive tax loss selling. You had massive shorts in a lot of these names.
"The glass is half full argument is exactly what you're alluding to. And now you've got a better and better likelihood of either a soft or no landing. That is a much bigger tailwind for earnings growth in the US. And that's one of the reasons, probably the right reason or the stock market has been as resilient as it's been"
The mystery is less why are stocks up versus why are parts of the market leading that really shouldn't be leading an environment where rates are still climbing.
"But I think the reality is in an environment where you avoid a recession where nominal GDP is let's call it four or 5% and rate volatility is probably going to be lower by the end of the year, that's not a bad environment, and it probably leads stocks higher by the end of the year."
"Cash actually doesn't look so bad right now, at least compared to some of the other parts of the curve, just given the fact that you are getting a lot to sit out."
"We're still going for quality and that's because we're in an environment where, again, the economy we don't think is going into recession, but there will be some deceleration and we're splitting the difference. On the growth value debate, we're going for GARP."
"GARP is a style growth at a reasonable price that tends to do really well when you have an economic deceleration, but not a contraction."
"So again, I think it's more about picking your spots, having companies with strong cash flow rather than making these big bets on tech or not tech."
"We're in the 8th, 9th inning and now it just comes down to valuations relative to the last five years based on growth is as good as we've seen."
"That's why I think right now, why these tech names continue to move higher, because what we see with fundamentals demand holding up and you have all that baked into the stock, which is why these stocks have moved up on lowered guidance and what I would say B plus type of earnings."
"I just think from a tech investor perspective, the macro is in the rear view. And now we're starting to get to an investor environment where a soft landing or a no landing looks like what we're seeing across tech earnings."
Artificial intelligence and about that data. That's the deep end of the pool because that's going to be an 800 billion dollar market and a minimum that we see over the next five or six years.
"I think you just continue to ultimately have an installed base that's increasing. 2 billion iPhones worldwide you had 975 million 18 months ago. Haters will continue to hate, but I think it will be a $3 trillion market cap."
"The people inside the Fed tend to be very, very focused on what their mandate is and they try to block out the political noise to the degree humanly possible, the mandate being to really bring inflation down to that 2% target. And that mandate is getting harder to wrap your head around right now because we don't understand the contours of inflation."
I have to say the last data print does make things a little challenging to read exactly the fundamental story of some disinflation from core goods and some hopefully coming disinflation from housing that's generally still intact.
"We've had the view for a long time that we'd have a soft landing, that we would not go into recession this year."
"You can have inflation get back down to target without a recession, but it's a narrow path. It's pretty difficult."
"Economy is still somewhat understaffed outside of tech, and I think it's that residual sort of catch up and hiring that's giving some support to what's going on."
"But if we can get the economy to slow down, fundamentally open up a bit of slack in the labor market without causing a recession, that's possible."
The way we measure housing inflation in the United States is not on home prices. BLS theory is that they want to separate out homes as an asset versus the flow of housing services that you get. And so that's why we have this concept of owners equivalent rent.
What you pointed out is that real wage growth has been negative because overall consumer prices have been rising faster than people's income.
Inflation tends to crimp people's spending behavior. And we have seen over the past couple of years a notable slowdown in consumer spending growth.
"The challenge, of course, is sorting out the cyclical part of inflation in housing, the cyclical part of demand in housing from a strong labor market, from that idiosyncratic, COVID driven part of things."
"So you have all these supply constraints, you have a lot of demand still and you have very strong pricing. And fuel costs have come off their highs. Looking good from a margin perspective."
The most inverted yield curve in 40 years. Money growth is negative. The impact of what the Fed did last year is yet to be felt on the economy. I think the market is ahead of itself and we're going to give a lot of this back.
Earnings estimates are going to come down somewhere. They come down a lot already. Stocks have a hard time moving significantly higher when earnings estimates are coming down.
"The Fed is not done raising rates, which means that the trading environment from 2022 will be coming back and the 60 40 portfolio will perform poorly."
10-Year Treasury yields have been creeping higher after a huge flood of cash into longer duration for the first month of the year.
I want to have a little about four and a half percent cash in my portfolio.
"And in the stock market I want to own a lot of the things that have not done well year to date, which are the things that did do well last year. Companies with earnings, reasonable valuations, good cash flow."
"I'd say it's the last hurrah for oil demand in China and close to the last hurrah for demand around the world. So we're not going to see with this recovery, we're not going to see this greater pull on demand coming back with the recovery."
"Partly because of the release of strategic oil, US has become by far the largest gross exporting country in the world. We're exporting close to 10 million barrels a day of oil, and that's after the SBR release was over. That's more than Russia, Saudi Arabia combined."
"And US supply is way up. If we look at real liquids, oil, biofuels, natural gas liquids, and the gains we get for running our refineries full out, we're at 21 million barrel a day producing country. That's kind of extraordinary, and nothing that we expected a year ago when this Russian Ukraine conflict started and emerged."
"Oil demand falling because of trade obstacles put in place in Trump administration, as well as an accelerating energy transition. Electric vehicle sales, particularly in China, where it's 39% of all sales in 2022, phenomenal growth in Europe and US is really not far behind."
"I think that the oil market remains very uncertain, but I think the biggest surprise over the last year is Russian exports of crude haven't changed. But where they're being exported to has changed very dramatically, massive shift away from Europe now."
"Everybody's been surprised by just the pace at which the China's relaxation of the COVID policy has happened and so revised up their views of all demand growth this year. If you look at most people now consensus out there would have oil demand growth of about 2 million barrels a day this year. Of that, around half of that is China. So they're massively important in the near term."
"Import less oil and gas, boost your domestic renewables. And that has a positive in terms of the energy transition."
"It's such an important point when people look at commodities, it's almost a proxy for global growth. If the economy does well, supposedly oil prices should go up. If the economy goes into recession, oil prices should go down."
Oil prices can stay low even with a decent global economy because of alternative forms of energy and change in business models focus on giving returns back to shareholders and reinvesting less.
"There's three factors behind Europe's better performance, that's consuming less gas, bringing coal back online, and just the fact that weather has been milder."
"Europe being the best performing region in the world this year. Yes, you had a growth story, but you're coming off 11-12x earnings."
"Commodities is an attractive place to go. And if we look at investments in the renewable side, they're blossoming. They're there in carbon capture, they're there in hydrogen, they're there in the areas where this new technology is working. That includes industry, it includes transportation, it includes buildings."
"I think history tells you that when you have these big companies like HSBC and you try and split them up, especially in regulated businesses like banks, it's not that it's impossible, but it's certainly difficult."
"Combination of strong bank earnings beats, higher interest rates and well, under book value valuations is a pretty attractive proposition."
"Looking at unit and price dynamics at big retail, Walmart is clearly seeing trading in, but Walmart is clearly also seeing a higher cost serve, as is Home Depot."
I think the problem that retailers are going to face is that it's just a higher cost to serve and margin structure may be very similar to pre-pandemic levels on a much higher sales base because costs keep flowing through.
"And case in point, Walmart called it out, obviously earlier, prior to reporting on labor, and Walmart, sorry, Home Depot did today in terms of their billion dollar investment in labor, cost of service just going up."
I think what you really have to look at is some retailers really leaned into investing during their sales gains. Investment did not flow through margins. And their margin structure hasn't really changed.
What's catching up to many retailers is you should never harvest your sales gains. You always have to reinvest.
"But I think investors are going to be shocked by the fact that those massive margin increases across much of retail are just going to be completely imploded and probably even be down relative to pre pandemic levels because cost to do business have gone up and sales are maybe higher or maybe not, depending on the retailer."
"The retailers that can offset some of that margin pressure with just better top line growth are club stores like Costco. But the rest of the retailers, I think you have another investment cycle coming."
"I think this rally has been very fundamentally driven. It's been this easing inflation and interest rate shock and less bad growth data. Now, there's going to be a pause you cannot annualize the degree of performance we've had this year."
"I think we can argue that the VIX is probably a sort of broken indicator here, but we would definitely be pulling back on some of the higher risk elements of the market here."
"S&P 500 equity risk premium is at its lowest level since 2007. When you're getting less compensation for taking on risk, it's a good time to be choosy."
"So I think we spent quite a long time thinking about how the war may affect energy markets. Energy economists will often talk about security, affordability and sustainability as the energy trilemma. You can't solve a trilemma, but the points of the importance of the trilemma is you need to balance all three of those different elements if you're going to have a successful and enduring energy transition. And I think there is a danger that prior to the war, the world had come focusing on just one element and had lost touch on those other two."
"Countries worrying more and more about energy security, a natural instinct will be to say, I want to reduce the level of imports I'm making of energy and instead boost my domestic energy. The nature of that is most domestic energy for many parts of the world, including in China, it's non fossil fuels, it's wind, it's solar, it's nuclear, it's hydro. Most of the energy that you import around the world, particularly in China, is oil and gas. And so one of the stories that we have in our outlook is we think the war is likely to accelerate the energy transition because of this energy security effect."
These higher bond yields are beginning to put a ceiling on valuations. And what was extraordinarily depressed in the investor sentiment three or four months ago is now less depressed. And that has been the sort of gasoline that's been poured on this rally in the last few months.
"If you've been lucky enough to ride that sort of 50% disruptive Tech rally off the October lows, I think now is the moment to rotate into cheaper, more cash flows, sort of defensive bits of the market."
"So I think it's cheaper, more cash flow generating stocks that are less exposed to this sort of potential valuation reset."
"With bond yields now rising, fair value PE for the S&P 500, it's down at 15-16x. It's not 18x."
"Historically, equities do not typically bottom before the Fed is advanced with cutting, and we never saw a low before the Fed has even stopped hiking."
"We may be exiting the best S&P EPS era, but we are likely entering the best stock pickers market in our careers. We think now is not a time to buy the (crowded) market index. Shifts in liquidity should drive opportunities within, and outside of, the index."
"Yields on 6-month T-bills are climbing to new post-2007 highs. Yields on 12-month T-bills have risen to their highest since 2001. Most of this has to do with Fed rate hike expectations, but the uncertainty surrounding the debt ceiling doesn’t help either."
Latest survey (of 553 investors) shows 1/3 of respondents say they need $3 million to retire comfortably. Another 1/3 say they need $5 million.
"But there's a PMI for services and it's dropped 20 points from 75 to 55. And there are plenty of services that I think are slowing, particularly in the financial services area, insurance, etc."
"There are half a dozen measures of rents, surveys of rents, and they've all slowed significantly, if not declined over the past nine months."
"And they lead the Shelter CPI by about eight months. So I'm a couple of months late now on this showing up, but I think the shelter is going to slow and then before you ask it, wages are going to slow."
"Following M2 and it's collapse so carefully because every time you had a bout of inflation, money growth accelerated 10-15%."
"We're already getting into an environment where life goes on because the economy is doing so well right now. I know there are lags involved, but the stock market is pretty contemporaneous and they know that rates are high."
"The Fed, I think, is doing a pretty good job of communicating what their plans are. If I was them, I would pause and see what they've gotten done so far. I would pause given how much water is under the bridge."
"China has gotten through the pandemic plus stimulus working through the system. Once they get the factories going, I think they'll be an increased source of exports. I think they're going to push up commodity prices like copper, but then come in and push down, finish good prices."
Shift to renewables away from oil and gas could feed into my strong view that inflation is going to be less than what people expect.
"So, you know, gravity will come to play a role at some point, but we have to land in a place where it's higher real rates or longer."
"Financials the most sold sector globally, full stop, right? And that's what's telling me is we have high front end yield, higher funding costs, but there's no loan demand out there"
"One of the big services is rents, and I'm convinced they're going to slow dramatically and maybe even go negative for the Shelter CPI."
"Then getting to today bank deposits, which are 85% of the money supply, are a practical way to track it every week, and they have declined significantly. They're down about 2% now, and they've declined 100 billion in the past two weeks."
"But last year, the money supply increased almost 30%. The year before that, government outlays increased 50%. And the Fed monetized it and now M2 last week was -3% which is an ominous or significant decline and it leads by 1-2 years. And I think it shows up in some of the slowdown of inflation readings we're seeing now, like container freight rates, natural gas."
"In 2021 inflation surged and many central banks sat idly on the sidelines. In 2022, central banks recognized their mistakes and vigorously tightened policy. It appears that 2023 will be the year when the effects of that hiking cycle more fully play through."
"In 1923, John Maynard Keynes wrote a paper that said the money supply leads by 16 months. So I've been surprised, but I haven't been fighting the idea. The economy is strong now because a year ago, Fed funds were zero. And so QT will show up more toward the end of this year."
Inflation around the world across history is often associated with wars. Think of the pandemic as a war. Governments spend a lot without asking too many questions about future taxes. Policy has to switch back to a pre-war regime.
"Velocity of money that has not picked up because people are still scared. But if we see the consumer demand and further down the industrial demand out there, then banks can start to lend."
"I will say that I'm watching most closely the price of oil, and that is my North Star as to how China is progressing right now. And oil prices are pretty quiet right now, around $75 for West Texas. And so that tells me that China hasn't gotten ripping ahead yet."
"Single-family existing home sales have plunged 36% year over year, which is worst annual drop since May 1980."
Mortgage applications for home purchases fall to a 28-year low. Housing looks far from bottoming. New bull markets begin with housing improving.
"On the no landing part, I mentioned long and variable lags, and they're pretty painful. Reinhart–Rogoff wrote a piece in early 2009 criticizing people that had moved to the view that we would have no recession, that housing weakness would be contained."
"In the second half of the year, households lose their excess savings. I think that leads to household fragility."
"I think it's even more difficult in the current environment. As I look at those Q4 GDP numbers, the downgrade to consumption is meaningful."
"You obviously have a debt ceiling, which could lead to financial condition tightening and weaker government spending."
"I think the recent data we've seen over the past several months, certainly the economy has momentum now. What we've seen from the jobs reports or retail sales or some of the survey data bottoming and picking back up all tells you I think that Q1 growth should be solid. It's certainly above trend, we think."
I think that the ongoing narrative that we hear from the Fed about this kind of gradual slowdown in growth over the coming quarters doesn't really seem to fit with the data that we have.
What we've seen from an inflation perspective is a lot less disinflation than we thought late last year. We see core inflation picking back up over the coming months. We think that leads the Fed to be more aggressive.
"The market has repriced the terminal rate a lot, but I think not enough yet. I think we will probably see the market repricing higher on upcoming inflation data."
"I think inflation is going to be structurally higher going forward. We have all these shifts going on, demographic forces, deglobalization, you have climate change policy. All these things, I think at the margin at least, are going to be inflationary."
"If you look at the labor market, and I think it's really important, it's not just the latest data points, because we should take the January data with some grain of salt, given weather, seasonal adjustment factors, we had meaningful upward revisions to household income."
"You've had inflation data, which was revised up meaningfully in Q4. So I think as you look at the Fed, I don't think that they will really have any evidence of disinflation by the May meeting."
"I think there's two lags that we probably want to talk about. There's what the Fed does and what happens with monetary policy to financial conditions. I think that lag has been very quick and tight. We saw it reflected in mortgage rates. Financial conditions actually tightened very quickly. And then there's the lag of that financial condition tightening onto the economy. I think that's where we are probably seeing an economy that's more resilient. You have the excess savings. We still think it's $1 trillion. At the same time, you have a labor market that's undersupplied which I think is making it very resilient to the tightening so far."
We have a debt ceiling debate that's going to be happening in the second half of this year which could lead to fiscal retrenchment.
"It's remarkable that the Fed has tightened as much as they have, and you don't see a labor market that is really certainly not shedding labor. I think the revisions to the recent data you've had plus the latest data show really no weakening at all."
I would highlight the core PCE number there as well. Upward revisions. I think it likely reflects the seasonal adjustment that we saw in the CPI now getting reflected in the core PCE data as well.
"I think that with the revisions to the data, with the incoming data we're seeing, there has to be a question about whether or not they are tightened sufficiently and whether or not what the market is pricing right now is tightening sufficiently."
"Yield on cash may be stimulative but as the Fed tightens monetary policy, we've seen what happens to mortgage rates, we've seen what's happened to the housing market, we see rising delinquencies on autos. But the bigger picture is certainly that it tightens financial conditions."
Everyone was kind of pessimistic 80% chance of a recession in the next year. We think that number is around 30%.
"If you think about coming into the beginning of the year, there were three reasons the market had done as well as it had done until a week and a half ago. First, positioning was incredibly bearish. We all knew that there was epic tax loss selling, which is why the stocks that were the biggest sellers, the ones that really had the weakest performance, are all the ones that rebounded that's been neutralized. Second, the benefits of the decline in inflation. Third, combination of the inflation reaction and the price action in the equity markets themselves have caused people to believe that the soft lending is now the base case."
Volmageddon 2 warning overblown. 0DTE options do is actually increase volatility intra-day. At the end of the day it's all neutralized and balanced once expired.
"You fixed the mortgage market, which was the problem of the last business cycle, and now you've kind of taken that piece away from monetary policy. With homes and mortgage prices, mortgage payments locked in, you're just not going to see monetary policy have the immediate impact on spending like you did during the 2005 rate hike cycle."
"Given the fact that at the end of last year, a lot of the pessimism came from this expectation of margin compression, we've got an earnings massive margin compression. It has not been priced in more significantly because price action sets the narrative. So you had two consecutive quarters of EPS reductions and the stock market rallied in the face of that."
"I think something when we look at the impact of higher rates, housing is clearly ground zero in terms of activity. And we often think that when housing falls like this, you would see a lot of layoffs in the construction sector and we haven't seen that really. So it's just one small example of how the dynamics this time around are really different. The labor scarcity that you're experiencing in construction remains.."
"We had this headline that an office landlord controlled by Pimco has defaulted on about $1.7 billion of mortgage notes across seven buildings. Commercial real estate is also interest rate sensitive, so we're going to see some of these valuations be impacted. Remember, there are just so many fewer data points and the data is lagging in that sector more than it is for the residential sector. So I think we're going to start seeing headlines like this. We know that office space is going to be challenged, especially in the major metropolitan areas. I think there are a lot of areas where we've continued to underbuild in this sector since the Great Recession"
"But from our point of view, this whole idea of multiple expansion happening before the economic downturn, however shallow, and we do expect a shallow downturn, doesn't really add up. We'd rather see that multiple expansion coming out of the short and shallow recession."
"We have a 5-6% terminal rate, which I think then builds into the hard landing risk later. We currently have the downturn in Q4."
"In every recession we go into it thinking, looking at our past, prior business cycles, pulling out the playbook and you just really have to rethink it every time."
"In the broad spectrum of options you have to invest in the investment world, you probably don't want to put your money into risky assets or equities. Bonds are your safe haven bet you're getting very high coupons, high yields, and you have the upside from a potential rally in bonds."
"If we get higher yields and fixed income prices go lower, the coupon will absolutely save me. Coupon makes the capital loss less painful."
"I mean, if you're looking at you're getting very high yields in the very front end of the yield curve, I would say that a lot of investors, even in their personal accounts, you start looking at five and a half percent returns in the very short end. It's very, very attractive. If you have cash to put to work, you'd probably want to put it in the bill market or the front end of the bond market because your returns are going to be very, very high and safe. You have a lot of volatility if you put that market into money, into risky assets."
"But broadly for the US, I feel like there's just going to be a wall of cash that starts entering the bond market again when 10-Year starts getting above 4% fixed income assets. In general, you look at corporate bonds, even ETF, just seeing a tremendous amount of inflows into the bond market. So I think that that sort of wall of cash is going to cap the rising years over the near term."
You're looking at negative 80 basis points in 2-10s.
And so they really should move 50 to reinforce their inflation fighting credibility and to slow aggregate demand in the economy.
"Everybody's focusing on the funds rate. It's still below the rate of inflation. If the funds rate is negative in real terms, is monetary policy really restrictive?"
"If you'd said 5% Fed Funds pushing six and then said 3-4%, unemployment and retail sales where that is, jobless claims where they are, I just wouldn't have believed it. The same thing with the ECB, this idea we're now going to push 4% from negative 50. Only twelve months ago, we were still doing QE in the United States."
"I think looking at market moves day to day, week to week is going to be very difficult. To predict directionality because it's just a lot of confluence of so many different factors to take into account."
The Fed is almost at the end of its rate hike cycle. So really what we're looking at is to see when that pivot will be calling.
"The timing of the pivot is going to be very difficult, but I think the destination is clear. Ultimately, the Fed wants to orchestrate demand destruction."
"Under those circumstances, what you're going to see is a slowdown in the economy eventually and recession. And that to us would mean that yields would have to go eventually lower timing when that's going to happen, exactly when that pivot is going to happen is extraordinarily difficult."
I think the yield curve is going to remain relatively inverted if ew near a 6% terminal rate.
"I don't see why the long end will sell off a lot and the yield curve will deepen. Unless the Fed is thinking about pivoting on policy, this is very much going to be a front-end led sell off in bonds."
Our view is that the US economy is going to go into recession in early 2024.
"The yield curve is going to remain inverted for a good portion of this year. We'll be looking to see when that yield curve starts to steepen. Both deepen as a sign, if you will, of when the Fed might potentially pivot."
"I think it is quite remarkable that bearishness and perhaps the intensification of the bearishness that we've seen over the last couple of days now. Tactically, equities have outperformed a little bit too much if we compare it to long dated real rates, if we compare it to interest rate volatility."
"So perhaps there's a bit of correction potential in US equity still fine, but we were pretty vocal, that whenever we are going to see such dips, we'd rather be taking these as opportunities to buy rather than really throw in the towel."
Continuation of market rally boils down really to the overall economics and to the earnings outlook and especially to expectations.
"The reality is that we went into the winter of 2022 and 2023 with extremely bearish expectations. Remember that perhaps three or four months ago, consensus was basically positioned for an absolute calamity to happen in the eurozone, right? A gas crunch, gas prices shooting higher, the real incomes being squeezed even more, and so on and so on. So we had very pessimistic expectations that only just started to really perhaps turn a little bit."
"Equity allocation is Eurozone equities, we're not overweight in the US or Japan. Because the US has outperformed that move in rates a little bit too much. But having said that, I think once we get those dips in US equities in the growth market that I do think with almost 80 basis points of rate hikes cumulatively priced now for the next couple of Fed meetings, I do think that there is actually at this starting point right now perhaps a little bit more potential for dovish surprises. So both for long duration assets in rates but also in equities. And then it will be the time to really use those dips to scale up exposure in US."
"Combination of the excessive fiscal stimulus and monetary stimulus is what drove excess demand and the higher inflation. After extra 2 trillion fiscal stimulus from Biden's March 2021 package, we had this huge bulge in household disposable income, a large portion of which was spent, some was saved, and now it's still trickling out."
"The biggest component, the shelter cost and rental costs, peak late spring, and then it's going to start to roll over, and that'll bring inflation down. But keep in mind, nominal spending growth is still too rapid. And then once that comes down, it takes a while for prices to adjust."
"I think the most serious mistakes investors make are performance chasing...whatever has done well, buy more. Whatever has faltered, shun it. And secondly, blinders, focusing strictly on domestic opportunities. I'm not bearish when things are cheap, stocks outside the US are reasonably cheap, value stocks outside the US are very cheap. And we find all sorts of narratives relating to China, relating to Ukraine for not investing outside the US. But the US is priced at more than twice the valuation multiples of non US stocks. And so to avoid those two mistakes, it's awfully useful to think in terms of forward returns, not past returns. And forward returns are simply a function of what's the yield, what's the historical growth in income, and if there's any valuation mean reversion towards historic norms."
"I think we are in a transition from a failed experiment with near zero and negative interest rates. That effort to stimulate an already growing economy was beyond foolish, and I think we're seeing the beginnings of a regime shift back to a point where interest rates matter. Think of interest rates as a speed bump. If you have a speed bump on a street that's too high, it stops the traffic. If you have a speed bump that's nonexistent, you're going to get the occasional reckless driver driving way too fast. And the same thing applies with interest rates. When interest rates are too high, the economy is shuttered."
"People talk about Powell channeling his inner Volcker. Pardon me, Volcker took the short rate to 500 basis points above the preceding peak in inflation. Today, that would mean making the Fed Funds rate 14%. He's not channeling an inner volker. He's dabbling with increasing rates in a fashion that hopefully won't do too much damage. And it's all based on a very naive neo Keynesian view that you have to wreck the economy in order to rein in inflation."
"If we get a normal rate regime, there's all sorts of companies out there, domestic and international, that just aren't going to make it. You can profit from that by investing broadly diversified into markets that are cheap and will cushion the damage of those. You can avoid that damage by looking at quality metrics and not investing in companies that are highly likely to go bust. You can measure interest rate sensitivity for companies, and companies that have large debt be very wary, don't own them unless they're really cheap. And there's a lot of companies in the meme stock community that have huge debt, and as that debt gets repriced, they're likely to struggle. So the notion that high interest rates are going to hurt the value stocks is actually way too simplistic."
"I think holding period should be a function of where your personal skill set is. I'm focused on long term. I'm a long term investor. I want short term investors to be there to provide the liquidity. And folks who are not good at short term but playing the short term game, they're also providing liquidity. But they're likely to get badly hurt and they often do."
"I think the whole active versus passive thing is a complete distraction. The passive managers own the market. That means that if you take them out of the equation, what you're left with is that same portfolio. That's what the active managers divvy up. So an active manager can win, but generally only if another active manager is losing. The before fee performance of actively managed mutual funds is nearly identical to that of passive. And it always has been and it always will be. So the key question is, can you choose active managers who are likely to have an edge and whose success will be funded by other active managers whose bets don't work? Look for that in your investing."
"There's a lot of data that matters, but I suspect we're going to be moving away from the traditional. What is GDP, what is the unemployment rate, what is CPI? We're going to have to get a lot deeper moving forward. And that's because, well, the nature of growth and how the slowdown is impacting the economy is likely to be uneven."
"We are probably going to see a lower unemployment rate than we have in past slowdowns or recessions, but the composition of it will matter. For example, during COVID we had millions and millions of job losses, but they were in low wage jobs that didn't hit GDP. In the coming, we might see those tech and finances having a larger impact."
Inflation will be problematic because it's not about the headline number anymore. It's going to be about what segment of remaining inflation is interest rate sensitive or not.
"We know the unwind from COVID is going to push down on the good side and services where you have that remaining component. But I'm looking a little bit further than that, which is right now we still have inflation that is interest rate sensitive. We're really pulling down on that excess savings, the demand side of the equation. But it's not so much goods and services that keeps me up at night. It's supply versus demand. And when we get to later this year, how is the Fed going to be commenting or combating the remaining inflation, which is food price inflation centric or geopolitical driven or ESG driven? We're going to have to have a moment, not just from the Fed, but from global central bankers. And I think it's going to start this year where they have to admit their ability to control that CPI number is weighing both on a cyclical factor in this year and next, but also on a structural basis."
"When the Fed says we want to get sufficient and restrictive, I think what they're looking for is more balance in the economy. And of course they are getting it. They got a lot of it in 2022. Here we are talking about what does the landing look like? I'm looking backwards at 2022 and saying, that looked like a landing to me. We had significant drawdown in housing a bear market in the S&P. Did that not qualify as a significant slowdown? Now we're looking down, we're saying we're landed. The question is, do we hit the wall at the end of this runway? That's what we're focusing on moving forward."
"When I look at the wall at the end of the runway, what concerns me actually isn't two quarters of negative growth that hasn't been for the last year. It's this concept of something we've been discussing internally, which puts a pit in my stomach, a concept like rolling recessions or when you look back in history, sometimes we see these periods of expansion downturns that fluctuate very quickly, very difficult to manage money in that type of environment. And if we're heading into a period where GDP is oscillating around zero slightly above, slightly below, we're going to spend all our time arguing over whether or not it qualifies as a recession or not, not focusing on the big story, which is we are not in reflation. We're much closer to stagflation, we are not in the Roaring 20s. We're going to be in a slower growth environment with a lot of particularities that we have not seen in the past."
"Based on our traditional leading indicators of the economy, by the mid to end of 2023, that's when we're probably going to start to see the consumer and the jobs picture begin to decline. But at the same time, we have to evaluate those leading indicators. Should we rely on them in the same way that we have in the past."
"In Canada and in many of the smaller developed economies, you have even less ability to control inflation with your domestic interest rates. And this is what the bigger bind for the Fed going into the next year is that if you're Australia or Canada, you're at the point where your impact on your economy from higher interest rates becomes much more severe, particularly because of the housing reliance and your ability to control inflation begins to decline. So when I think about the Fed versus the bank of Canada, what I see is a problematic situation where the Fed can tighten global financial conditions, but the bank of Canada cannot. It's going to create a much bigger divide between the central banks moving forward."
"Take a look at the employment to population ratio. 40% of Americans are not working. Move aside the labor force participation rate and all of its equivalents. We're also looking at an economy where we have fewer people than before the pandemic. We're missing over 2 million workers. A lot of them retired early. A lot of them got fed up with this market. A lot of them are dealing with childcare and health issues. We have not come to the reality yet that our concepts of demand and supply for labor, for wages, may not work the same way our textbooks told us they did for the last several decades. So our new equations on how to evaluate what brings labor back to the market, I think those are going to have to change pretty significantly."
"We know from history if you make people poor enough, they will have to go back to work. But is that what we should be doing, and is that what central bank should be doing. And this is the big challenge I have when I hear central bank saying we're going to reduce demand to bring it back into supply. But when you have supply shocks that are continuous, is really the medicine worth cure in this particular environment? What is the role of a central bank? Control inflation and employment or make the lives of the citizens of this country better? This was going to be a problematic question for central banks moving forward."
"We're all not just the general public, but financial services are also going to have to have a moment where we realize monetary policy dominance, which has ruled so much of the way that we invest money and live our lives. We maybe see that challenging, especially because moving forward, the inflation in the system is likely to become less interest rate sensitive, not more. We're going to have to have a moment where we come and recognize that central banks need to do it, investors need to do it. Eventually the general public will do it too."
"I think the chairman of the Federal Reserve over the number of years has been the most important banker. Now is he banker to the world? Is he here to bail out the rest of the world? No, not necessarily. They only have really two objectives that's inflation in the United States and the unemployment rate."
"So you think about the Taylor Rule, there's two variables in there. One would be inflation and one would be the unemployment rate. I think there the overwhelming weight is on inflation right now. The Fed right now is much more reactionary than forward looking. It's all about where's the economy right now and they're kind of really trying to feel their way in."
"So if you think about the consumer right now, the consumer is very, very strong financially. And so you could have a recession this year in, say, manufacturing, strong dollar, weaker growth in the rest of the world, you could have weakness in the housing market. That's what we've seen for the last almost year now. But consumer spending could continue to hold in there. And given the fact that consumer spending is 70% of the economy, you could have a few sectors in the economy in kind of a recession, and the overall economy wouldn't necessarily need to tip into recession."
"So you can have different sectors going down and not the whole ship going down. Now, if some of those sectors go down a lot, like manufacturing and housing, and then you start to get job losses in there, then it does start to bleed into other sorts of sectors in the economy."
"But the reason that we're cautious on equities is really that if you look at where valuations are, it's pricing in a very modest kind of growth outlook for the economy as well as for earnings as well. And if you look at where rates are, as you know, we have been of the view that they cannot cut rates now. Markets are moving closer to our view, but markets are still looking at rate cuts later in 2024. And we think that actually, given how a resilient economy has been and how much the recession will be pushed out later down the line, actually rate cuts also needs to be pushed out further as well. Equity market in the developed world are not quite appreciating some of the macro challenges that we see happening. And that's why we have been prudent. Our time horizon is six to twelve months, and some of the metrics that we use to support the cautious view is valuation based. But that is not to say that we cannot have shorter term bouts of rally, which we saw in January, like driven by technical factors, short squeeze, driven by FOMO flows as well. Real money investors are telling us that what after a year like 2022, they cannot afford to miss the rebound."
The new regime is predicated in terms of the macro drivers of the current environment that we are moving from the great moderation with economic cycles shaped by demand to the current environment shaped by supply and supply constraint.
"Like people say as we head into recession we got to shy away from value. But we're also in an environment where rates are going higher and curve in our view should steepen over that six to twelve month horizon. So we actually think that there is more room for value to perform, but we want to be a bit more selective."
"So we like front end of the curve, over the back end of the curve you take very little duration and credit risk, you get paid, T-Bill is paying you almost 5% and commercial papers are paying you 5.5%. These are very attractive income opportunities and given our view that actually rates will stay longer for higher for longer, we don't necessarily want to kind of go into the long end of the curve especially given how inverted curve is at this current juncture, term premium should come back. It's underappreciating the degree that we're going to have to live with inflation, and we do want to kind of sit out."
"So the reason that we currently are shying away from developed market equity or modestly underweight is because we don't see the macro challenges being fully priced in. So we're bunkering down in short end of the curve. But if market pricing changes getting closer to our fair value, that would certainly change things as well. But also actually on a global basis, we like emerging markets. We have an overweight, very modest, overweighting emerging market equities. So think of our view currently like a barbell between the short end of the government bond market in the US and emerging market equities."
The last thing I would say is that this is an environment with very heightened macro and market volatility. We have to change our views very quickly.
"And I think the point that we make with asynchronous is that you can have slowdown in all of the economy, but at slightly different times, and that might defy the NBER definition of recession. So what we're thinking, and we're getting some of it in the data now, we've got this sort of nuance coming through from trade. We've got this nuance from inventory. So that's probably weak in the first half of the year. The consumer looks pretty solid, though. And I think it's as we move into the second half of this year, particularly if we get the slowdown coming through in the labor market, that you'll see a softening in the consumer side. So typically, and this is why recessions are so difficult to forecast, at least in terms of timings. You get a synchronized slowdown, and that's when you see recession. If you get it asynchronously one quarter is negative, then perhaps it's flat, then it's negative again. Remember, we've already had two quarters of negative growth at the NBER, looked completely through. And that wasn't a recession and that was just last year. So we could get a sort of sawtooth pattern of GDP come through, which would be a muddle through. And I guess typically that would be a soft landing."
"So we think that headline inflation is going to fall back to around possibly just under three and a half percent by mid year. And that's why we've always said the Fed is not going to be in a position to be able to ease in the second half of this year, which markets have repriced quite significantly now. But we also think it takes a little while throughout 2024 to get that down and they need to crack the labor market."
"I mean, if we see this asynchronous so growth is just slightly firmer than that, then the labor market doesn't loosen by quite as much and that will take a little bit longer for prices to fall. But no, that's exactly the risk."
"But the point of that is that now central banks are using backward looking information to judge when they've done enough with their forward acting tools of monetary policy. So they're looking in the rear view mirror. They're using the labor market to judge when they've done enough, when they know that rate hikes are still going to have a lagged impact on financial conditions going further. And that, I think, is the biggest risk if you're using backward looking information to judge when you've done enough with your forward acting tool. It sounds like a recipe for overtightening."
"The move that you would get if you followed a Bullard type approach, is it's much more consistent perhaps with Fed history that you could see the rates move a little bit higher to peak, maybe, you know, even towards a peak of 6%. But then once you reach that, you would break the economy. You would have to see rate cuts follow quite quickly. And I think what the bulk of the committee wants to achieve this time around is a peak that isn't quite as eye watering as that, but it is held in place for a little bit longer and that provides the restrictiveness that slows the economy further."
"Central banks need to see some impact come through and they need to see that in the labor market, and particularly for the US. 512,000 is absolutely nowhere near enough to see a slowdown in economic activity and average earnings growth needs to be closer to three and a half and they'll need to see that before they pause."
Markets are adjusting to the fact that the Fed has more work to do and this monetary tightening is not taking a bite out of the economy. This is bad news for inflation and bad news for the market. And that's why we're generally thinking that the market is going to have trouble continue to move to the upside. Likely a trading range or downside risk from here.
Fed stays in a holding pattern with rate hikes and then a pause until we can get some kind of break on inflation in terms of wages or shelter or spending on services.
I think it is the short end of the yield curve that's going to continue to look more and more attractive versus the long end.
"So starting with retail, I think consumer and the employment markets are going to be the piece of the puzzle that determine the depth of the timing of a recession. So consumer, I think, is at risk. That's not an area that we're incredibly interested in."
"We're more on the conservative side, looking for quality companies and also some beta outside of the US. So starting in the US with quality companies, companies that tend to grow their dividend, they tend to have strong balance sheets, they're more recession resilient, provide you some income protection going forward. So this is everything from infrastructure companies that are backed by utilities and waste management all the way over to companies like Coca Cola, which tend to be a bit more defensive in a volatile market. Now, outside of the US, we think emerging markets look attractive because of valuations. There also the dollar, which may not be as strong as it was last year, and also China continuing to reopen. I think EM finally has a tailwind. You could see some upside there. So kind of a balanced bet there, but staying a little bit more conservative in the US. Because of the continued rate hikes that we see and the potential for a recession that may be delayed but likely still come."
"Well, first of all, just going to look at energy companies. I think that we've seen this with them for quite a number of years. They are more focused on returning cash to shareholders than on pulling barrels out of the ground. That's keeping supply tight for energy companies. And we agree that oil prices likely have more upside because demand remains reasonably strong, supply remains tight."
"Cash is an interesting asset class in the sense that it is paying good yield. My caution in terms of cash flow, of course, is that the markets tend to price in a recovery well before we see any of the data. So it's a timing issue and when you're trying to time the market, usually that's generally a loser's game. "
"I would continue to look for areas where you see good value. Now, these are areas like non US markets, particularly emerging markets. "
"Fundamentals versus valuations of municipal bonds are at a mismatch because of the strength of the economy and the tightening that's not impacting the economy yet municipalities still look very strong. You're seeing total returns in municipal bonds and also areas of taxable fixed income such as leveraged loans that still look very attractive to us. And again, that's why it's important to make sure you use your cash wisely because you are seeing entry points that you haven't seen in years or even decades in many of these asset classes, such as fixed income."
"Farmland is a historical asset class that we've been very heavily invested in all the way back to the TIA days as our parent company. It's an asset class that we thought was very resilient, hedge to inflation, and important obviously to society. in a world where equities and fixed income have become very correlated, alternatives such as farmland have been a very important piece of investors portfolios."
"But what's interesting here is that there's a lot of hard questions about their strategy from three years ago to kind of button up with shareholders. Goldman brand supposedly was going to conquer the consumer market and it didn't.  And that might have been being too confident, and I think it's block and tackle the next two years, which will be profitability and return of capital. But the missing question here is that's great to be a great investment bank, but to be a great financial service company, you have to have recurring revenue work through the cyclical parts of the market. And we're talking about Schwab, BlackRock. These are stable. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs still is an agent. It is really dependent on client servicing that is always difficult to get a higher valuation. They just want to kind of have a calm where they can tell shareholders, we're going to be more efficient, we're going to use less capital, and we're also going to find ways to be profitable and be smart, because they certainly weren't smart with their strategy before. So there is a really big question within this, which is how are they going to expand more into that stable kind of business, the asset management that you're talking about, without making an acquisition, without making major investments, and without even laying out any kind of path to do so in this presentation. When you look at their presentation, it's not going deeper and bigger in terms of asset management or alternative investments because that's very choppy. It's going to be more the wealth management side, the advisory side, or in areas like Larry Fink had, which was from getting the I shares with EPS.  So in time, when they need to look for a more predictable recurring revenue stream and a lower source of funding, it might be some of the Custodial banks or even State Street, which has a great ETF franchise. I think if it's any of the businesses that require significant capital, they will reduce their footprint. For others, which are transaction driven and they can leverage with partners, they'll certainly find ways that it could be incremental revenue and profit. But the big play is over."
"So the bank of Japan has work to do. The end of the fiscal year is now just a few weeks away, March 31, and there are substantial capital losses on what I'll call the ultra long segment of the JGB market, the part where they haven't been trying to control the yield curve. So those yields are up about 70 basis points compared to where they were at the end of the last fiscal year. And that implies between 30 and ¥60 trillion worth of capital losses, which are big enough to wipe out the balance sheets of a lot of the institutions. So the bank of Japan and the Finance Ministry are going to be out there in size over the next few weeks buying up this asset, encouraging buy the asset. They're going to move the market lower, they'll do it, but it'll be quite a challenge for them."
"Well, at the short end of the yield curve, out to ten years, BOJ owns I think the number is about 65% to 70% of the market. And then at the ultra long end, they own a lot less because their target has been to control yields from overnight out to ten years."
"Bank of Japan governor designate Ueda said this in testimony the other day. The BOJ can't buy bonds forever, and some point this has to come to an end. When it does, there will be capital losses in the bond market. And yes, I think that will that will imply that will generate some institutional risk."
"The rest of the world is grappling with deeply entrenched inflation, at least by all accounts. And what we saw this morning out of Europe with respect to German's 9.3% February CPI read year over year."
"The inflation adjusted money supply in Europe is still four and a half percent higher than it ought to be given the current level of output in recent trends. So, sure, there's too much money chasing too few goods, and that's pushing up prices. I view this as a price adjustment that will run its course when real money supply is deflated back to where it should be by a combination of quantitative tightening and by rising prices. So we still have more price increases to go. But there is an end in sight to this process. This is not the spiraling inflation that we saw in the don't think interest rates matter nearly as much to the ECB and to the course of inflation in Europe as quantitative tightening does."
"We've had negative real interest rates in Europe since the financial crisis, and it's time to straighten that out so that investment doesn't get misallocated and so the economy can grow in a healthy way. That's a good outcome here, but as they move much beyond 200 basis points or 300 basis points above inflation expectations, it'll become restrictive and they'll start to make recessions that are already going on even worse."
"The price increases we're seeing in the United States are coming about, in my opinion, because we've got excessive cash balances in the United States. Also cash balances are over $2 trillion higher than where they ought to be given trends in the growth of the economy. And until that gets sorted out by a one time rise in prices and or by quantitative tightening, we're still going to see prices going up here."
"I think we started this year looking at a market that was driven by better than expected economic data. We saw a strong January jobs report, we saw better than expected retail sales and we certainly saw inflation, at least towards the back half of last year, starting to move lower. I think the trade into what we'd call more cyclical parts of the market probably happened too fast, too soon earlier on this year."
"As we get through this year, we need to see a couple of things before we can kind of revisit that recovery playbook or that cyclical playbook. We would still need to see, one, of course, inflation move meaningfully lower. Two, we'd like to see the Fed actually step to the sidelines at some point, probably middle of this year. And then three, we are starting to see earnings being revised meaningfully lower at this point for 2023. We haven't seen that bottom yet. So until those conditions are in place, we'd say probably the market is going to take a more defensive tilt. We could see continued volatility, but at some point when those conditions are met, maybe towards the back half of this year, we do think that investors should think about diversifying into those more recovery parts of the market. That includes quality growth. That means growth that is not negative earnings yielding probably not as speculative parts of the market. And then, of course, areas like cyclicals, even parts of small caps, international as well."
"It's very dangerous to extrapolate the strength we saw, certainly in the labor market, certainly in the consumer to the rest of the year. Keep in mind, the labor market does tend to be one of the lagging indicators. And the labor market tends not to usually be the first shoe to drop, but perhaps towards one of the last shoes to drop."
"We do still think a twelve month time horizon, although we've been talking about twelve to 24 months, because that's really when we can see this cycle go through a bottoming process and then markets can then start looking towards a recovery process."
"We do think investors have a very unique opportunity in the twelve months ahead in that we know bear markets don't happen all that often, one every four to five years. But in history, the good news is every bear market has ended and every bear market has been followed by a potential bull market."
"And look, I think when we look at the last ten years or so, the ten years after the financial crisis, that was an environment that was characterized by Fed funds rate towards the zero bound growth outperformed value for much of that period because investors were pushed out the risk spectrum. We think about the next ten year period or so, we don't necessarily see yields back at the zero bound. Certainly the Fed funds rate could go from this five, five and a half percent back to more neutral territory. But in that environment, we do think investors have to consider a balance between value and growth and think about a more diversified picture and leadership going forward."
Defense is usually just what works when things are bad. And last year defense was energy because that's what worked when things were bad.
"But we think more traditional defensive sectors, health care staples in particular, if we do go into any sort of economic downturn slowdown those sectors which have underperformed thus far this year, we may see some interest and some more leadership come out of that. More traditional recession proof and even to some extent inflation proof part of the market."
"What's interesting, I think this time around defense is also your shorter duration CD, one to two year treasury bond space as well.. Of course, what's notably different this cycle is that cash and cash like instruments are yielding anywhere from four to 5% plus. And that is an environment where, you know, if investors do want to hang out, think about a recovery playbook, but in in the meanwhile, put their money in very attractively yielding assets."
"I think the point about Germany and core Europe reacting viscerally to inflation is excellent. Talking to clients over many, many years, that's always been the big fear in Germany, for obvious historical reasons. Whether it's sticky, whether it's accelerating. It's just simply too high."
"We were talking for years about how we couldn't really exit the zero rate regime, this negative rate regime, without more ripples, without more consequences in financial markets. Now we're talking about a four, five, 6% regime, depending on which nation you look at. And we're not seeing the ripples in terms of difficulty in borrowing questions around the validity of stock valuations in any kind of existential level."
"When you think about corporate borrowers, there's a bit of a lag function. Probably takes a couple of quarters for corporate default rates to go up meaningfully, but it's very likely going to happen here in the US. You probably look at something like a 7% default rate, for instance, in high yield this year. That's material, but it takes a while to get through the system."
"So I've been more in the camp the ECB would not deliver. But after seeing this parade of very nasty inflation prints, I think you've got to lean towards ECB. Going 50 this month is virtually a lock and 50 next month looks more and more likely. So very tough to fade the ECB, very tough to fade the euro right now."
"People don't want to subsidize anything, losing money, whether it's a Goldman or a tech company or fintech."
But I think Goldman and their ethos came up yesterday. But when they have a bad trade they normally don't sit on it.
"I doubt the yield signals depressed growth or a duration of subpar economic growth. And here's why. If you look at where neutrality is, I would suggest neutrality is around 3%. Why 3%? 3% is two two and a half percent inflation, a half, 1% real yield. And if I look at the back end of the curve, it's not discounting a break below three. That's hugely important for me. So I think we've had this unprecedented degree of monetary tightening. It still in absolute terms, leaves us at approaching five and a half percent. Big picture. That's not huge. We've come from zero to five and a half, but not huge. If we get there and we're done, and the next move is down, and let's suppose the Fed gets down to 3%, that's a very tolerable outcome. And it doesn't suggest anything like what you've just described."
The risk of inflation persisting at a higher level is a bigger risk than rate hikes killing the economy.
"But I think the way the Fed is pursuing policy here is kind of smart. I know the Fed gets a hard rap because of missing the early rate hikes, but 25s from here is quite smart. They got to keep on twenty fives and level off. And at a certain point in time, this degree of tightening has got to hurt."
You look at lending standards out there. They are as tough as they've been since the great financial crisis. But we're not seeing that in the data.
"If you look at policy rates right now perhaps it's not really restrictive given recent data and stickiness of inflation. We're not seeing it in the data for January, potentially for February. There's a weather impact there. There's a seasonal adjustment factor there."
"If you stand back and look at the direction of travel for the data over the past year, we are seeing the impact with the exception of the labor market. The labor market is where we have this remarkable anomaly where we still can't get people to work, which is incredible to be in that situation right now. That is going to crack, though. We've got to remember that the replacement number in payrolls is 150. Once we get to below 150, we're in growth recession territory. If we go mildly negative, we're in recessionary territory. We don't have to go to a deep recession territory, but the indicators are we're heading in that direction and it'll be over the next couple of quarters that we see that come to bear."
"We can't live with five, by the way. 5% is not an equilibrium, and the equilibrium is down to three. This is a really unusual set of circumstances. I mean, there are so many anomalies here relative to previous cycles. I think people are not getting a lot of stuff because it's tough, it's all over the place, and it goes back to the inversion of the curve and how unusual that is. And I would say the other big anomaly out there is how calm the system is. You look at where credit spreads are, very contained. There's very little concern about anything breaking. So when I say we're not going to go back there, show me a reason to go back there. Something's got to break. And so far something hasn't broken. And until we get that, I think up to 5%, down to 3%. It's a pretty tolerable outcome. It includes a bit of a growth recession, but not the doom and armageddon."
"Well, the productivity numbers, if we look at them in year and year terms, are actually deep into negative territory, almost down 2%. So we have very strong job gains in an economy that is slowing. So that's not really sustainable, but it can kind of run that way and the inconsistency can last for at least multiple quarters."
"So let's look at that unit labor cost number in year on year terms. So 6% plus on a unit labor cost, if we look at the employment cost index running at 5%, these are the elements of wage price spiral. And I know Chair Powell has said he doesn't think we're in a wage price spiral at the moment, but once you're there, it's too late and it's a very expensive problem."
Let me give you a historical. Annual average productivity decreased 1.7% from 2021 to 2022. The BLS says the largest annual decline in the measure since 1974.
"We're seeing persistent inflation everywhere, including in wages, and there was a little bit of a rollover in Q4. And so team transitory was putting on their sneakers to run a victory lap. And it's pretty clear that that has kind of washed out now in the most recent data. So we have to see how far this is running."
"But certainly I see evidence of labor market softening everywhere I look, except for in the economic data. If you open the newspaper, you'll see layoffs here and hiring intentions down and all those signals. But in the actual macroeconomic data, you're not seeing the cooling of conditions."
"When you have that kind of heat in the labor cost pressure series on an extended basis, businesses have no alternative aside from making the capital investments and the technological investments to drive a productivity rebound. We surged in productivity coming out of the pandemic, right? So now this is the correction period, so we shouldn't get too depressed about the low productivity number."
Jobs and CPI will have a much bigger influence on the Fed.
"US service sector inflation, which is what is really driving the Fed reaction function, is showing very little evidence of any kind of disinflationary trend. And you won't see that with wage pressures continuing to accelerate higher."
"It's hard to pick the absolute top in yield. I don't have a ton of confidence in the front end because we know inflation is sticky. We know core services ex shelter is driven by wages. It's a very tight labor market, and companies are hoarding labor. So it's possible that inflation remains persistently high through the year. And the Fed, we think, in 25 basis point increments, may have to keep hiking maybe 5.75, maybe 6%. So, you know, that very front end of the yield curve, I think, is very driven by data in the near term. The long end, that's your neutral rate view. And I think the data is strong on the consumer, on the labor market, not because policies are restrictive. We are in restrictive territory. It's because the lags have not worked through. I mean, the Fed fund rate crossed 4% only in December. You have to give the economy more than two months for it to keel over. And I think that's why the long end is selling off. People expect that interest rates don't matter. I think interest rates matter. They just take a while to show up in terms of business investment decisions or spending decisions."
"So economic theory suggests twelve to 18 months for monetary policy to work through. I mean, you could argue maybe it's a little bit shorter, maybe it's twelve months, nine months."
"I will say something that may be making the lags longer this time is that the consumer entered the hiking cycle with a large amount of accumulated savings. Now those savings are running off. We're thinking in the third quarter those savings are largely gone. That's when the consumer has to start to reckon with higher interest rates, tighter financial conditions, maybe a job market that's not as strong. I mean, there may not be a lot of firing, but job openings start to come off. So I think it's more later this year that we think consumer spending slows down, the job market starts to weaken. But today, if I have a job and I'm making 5% wage gains and I've got savings, I'm spending. I think we're just saying, be careful in extrapolating that because those savings will run out by the end of the year."
"So I have much more conviction on the 10-Year and the 30-Year than I do on the front end. A few weeks ago I started to leg in, I would leg in some more. We entered some around 3.80, we enter some more longs at 4%. These 4% tens will look really cheap, but it's for the peak of 410, maybe it goes to 425. So I think you want to have some dry powder to keep adding to it."
I think the Fed is telling you that they have to engineer a hard landing. They're not going to say it because it's very hard politically to get that through. But how do you get inflation down without a rise in the unemployment rate? So the Fed will have to engineer a rise in the unemployment rate. I don't think the economy can handle very high real rates in the long run.
"So I think there are some structural factors that might be moving inflation a little higher like productivity, demographics, savings glut."
"If the Fed thinks they want to get to 2% inflation, they're going to keep policy restrictive for a while."
"Look at where 10-Year real rates are and the speed of the move over the last year. The extent of tightening, I think, can move us from ultra accommodated to ultra restrictive."
"But no doubt right now, for the next three to five years, China is going to continue to be the heart and lungs of the supply chain. So it's something where it would take a long time to start to move 5-10 percent of production."
"Some of the parts bull case gets you to 225 to 240. Base case, 200. I think the big thing is the services business, and that's a permanent rerating that we see there. And now when you start to see more and more, especially with the next iPhone, and you have 25% of the base that have not upgraded and there's a stock that's going to have a two in front of it, this year, despite the macro and obviously many negative. Of course, you have the franchise hardware business and then you start to look at the capital allocation program."
"Clearly the topic that cash is back, bonds are back, yields are higher, we can find a lot of attraction simply being at the front of the yield curve. But the minutiae which really investors and savers need to think about is the fact that depository rates are low. They need to be incentivized to really look at that move out of one and 2% depository rates out the curve even into T-Bills, short term strategies, two year notes, things like that."
"Fed is data dependent, but that's also going to create an evolving process. Not necessarily that now that we're approaching the 5.4-5.5% terminal rate that people expect, but more importantly that the cutting mechanism is focused less on supporting growth. We know that and that's a fundamental change compared to where we've been over the past few decades in terms of that."
"Don't necessarily be worried about liquidity conditions in the near term. There's plenty of excess reserves around in the system and et cetera. But the higher nominal rates that we are experiencing within the broader economy are going to have reverberations within corporate credit, within various structures, and we're going to see that proliferate."
"So investors need to be thinking about how to go about maintaining their degrees of freedom, high degrees of liquidity, and more importantly, embracing these higher yields, which simply are going to be a much more acceptable place to be."
"Even the most sophisticated institutional investor, they're really not moving money into yield as quickly as you would expect and there's actually pretty big diversions. Sure, a lot of retail investors are now focused on the high amounts of cash sitting in their accounts. They're well aware of yields where they are today, that's making an attraction to bonds a well known thought process over the past few months. But the reality is that it's still an evolutionary process."
"The higher yields that we are sitting here talking about today, even a 4% 10-Year note, is a relatively new phenomenon, especially in the history in the post GFC world. So we need to think about the construction of portfolios in a much more widespread criteria than simply the past six weeks and that's really what we're going to do."
"And so if you think inflation is going to be higher, you have to think where the neutral rate should be, which obviously affects where you think you should be buying duration, buying bonds."
"What is your horizon? What is your investment horizon? What is your purpose? Is it liquidity management? Is it something to plan for buying a house over the next two or three years, even though mortgage rates are higher? There's a variety of circumstances. So understanding and matching your investment needs with the investment itself is actually important. And that's probably going to be the main driver of how much or where an interest rate curve you end up buying."
"The framework is not necessarily supporting growth at this point in time. It's fighting inflation at this point in time, something very different. So it's going to be a bit of a long and dusty road to that destination. We should expect a little bit more volatility. We've clearly witnessed that over the past few weeks. Ultimately, it's a question whether the Fed takes the high road or the low road proverbially and literally with rates and understand where it's ultimately going to go."
"What you're suggesting by moving to those higher rates is a more methodical, very drastic rationalization of return expectations, risk, risk assumptions, spread assumptions. So there is very much a recalibration that would go on tightening conditions and you might actually see some breakage at that point in time."
"But I also think that what you're hearing clearly from the Fed is the process which is going to be a digestive situation where they're going to digest the data. And the market has rationalized over the past few weeks not necessarily that there's a lot of more rate hikes to come, but there's less cuts to come. And there's a big difference in that. So even at Pimco, we've shifted our expectations of a recession this year, push, possibly pushing that out to 2024. So modest growth in 2023, perhaps pushing that out to 2024, that's something that actually creates a longer road for the Fed to really rationalize decisions, be more data dependent, fortunately or unfortunately, and maybe doesn't necessarily create that shock to the system that that you're suggesting."
"But the reality is that there's one thing very different in the calculus today than October: yield. When you think about total return, whether it's a short term bond fund, a total term bond fund, income, it's the composition of capital appreciation plus yield. And that yield and carry component is worth 500 plus basis points, depending on the type of strategy at this point in time that in and of itself can alleviate a lot of the capital appreciation or depreciation. So when I said before, be careful owning the two year note because it's actually a negative total return this year. Yes, we're looking at a microcosm of a couple of months. In general, if you're holding it to maturity, you will make those yields, but there's different ways to manage your interest rate exposure. Interest rate exposure is a sensitivity."
"I think what investors are looking to do is simply navigate the next one to two years with uncertainty in the macroeconomics. You own equities because you believe that there is a rate stabilization and inflation understanding that is going to be stable for the next umpteen years and that inevitably owning an equity is effectively owning a long duration bond with some given profitability, earnings and obviously risk free rate assumptions baked in. What we ultimately want to think about though, is investors have had a lot of reinvestment to do over the past few years and then they were faced with uncertainty, wars, pandemics. These are all factors that really change the psychology of investors that we have to think about things that we haven't seen in many years. In fact, many traders today on Wall Street, young people haven't seen many of the phenomenon that we are witnessing today, even positive rates, as an obvious example, inflationary expectations in the general population. These are things that we haven't seen in 40 plus years. So the calculus is ripe for a pause. It means that traditional mechanisms for just simply earning interest put the baton firmly in the hand of savers. And it doesn't necessarily mean you need to make these bold predictions in terms of taking a lot of risk at this point in time. Having some optionality just like the Fed is exactly what investors want to do at this point in time."
"I think one of the healthy debates in there is not necessarily just where the neutral rate will be and where their interest or inflationary expectations come down, but really how sticky they are going to remain. So the consequences, the Fed is going to probably remain on hold, they're going to be faced with PCE core PCE that are well above that 2% number. We don't necessarily see that coming down until 2024, possibly 25 at the earliest."
"It's interesting because we did see that pop in consumer activity at the start of the year, but at the same time we saw consumer confidence tick down at the start of the year. So it doesn't appear as if the consumer is increasingly confident in their financial footing. It appears more as if we're seeing the consumers last stand, if you will. As households are drawing down the very last of savings, they're ramping up credit card debt."
"So they're going to have to see a marked decline in consumer activity translating into then significant job destruction in order to see confidence in the sense that wage pressures are coming down. Now earlier we were talking about services and for the Fed that's where the focus lies. In core services excluding housing. They want to see that proxy for the wage price spiral show improvement and we just haven't seen that yet. So while we are confident that as the Fed continues to raise rates, the economy will slow and by extension the consumer will slow, there's still a considerable amount of work left to be done."
"Traditionally the impact from earlier policy metrics take about six to nine months to filter into financial markets. But now, arguably, that lag is much shorter. If you think about all of the transparency that we have with the Fed, we didn't have a press conference at every Fed meeting in the past. We didn't have a summary of economic projections every quarter. We didn't have every Fed official taking the stage at every opportunity to explain not only what the Fed has done, but what they're going to do. So arguably there's an anticipatory nature of financial market reactions and I do think that has significantly reduced the lag or the need for the Fed to pause and take a look back."
"High inflation could solve high inflation on the supply side. But on the demand side what we're seeing is this lingering imbalance between labor demand and labor supply and that will not be solved by high inflation. That becomes the wage price spiral that the Fed so greatly fears, where high inflation leads to even higher inflation. So for the Fed, I don't think simply standing by the wayside and allowing natural markets to clear itself will be a long term solution"
Absolutely realistic that the Fed could get to 6% in the Fed funds rate. That has been our long standing call for the terminal rate.
"But given the fact that the market and the Fed consistently underestimates the sticky nature of inflation, what we've seen is the Fed consistently revised higher their forecast now 230 basis points higher than that initial forecast in March of last year."
"I think if we do get to a 6% rate and have to hold at 6%, I think we're increasing the probability of a hard landing. If, however, the Fed pushes up to 6%, realizes that they're sufficiently restrictive, and then come back to a five, five and a half percent range, we may be able to mitigate some of the depth or duration of the downturn. But from the Fed's point of view, a period of pain is not only likely, but necessary for the economy reinstate price stability."
"We're going to see a significant decline to housing valuations at a 6% terminal rate. But remember, when we talk about this housing market cycle, I think it's a very maybe superficial analysis to assume that because it's the most interest rate sensitive sector of the economy, as the Fed raises rates, the housing market falls off a cliff. This time around, we went into the cycle with a multi year deficit in terms of housing stock. And so even with demand coming off of peaks and supply arguably coming off the lows. We still have a disconnect in the market that should provide somewhat of a floor to this housing market cycle, even if we continue to see downward momentum from here."
"Right now the stock market thinks everything's great. The bond market that says this could be dangerous, look at the curve, it's inverted, we could have problems. So we think last year the bond market was right. This year it's a little trickier. We're seeing that the bond market is looking a little weaker in the sense that stock market is looking positive, saying, hey, wait a minute, we might pause. Either way, we're not there. Which means that even if the stock market is right and we pause, we could see the end of the curve steepen severely and that would cause negative trends in the long end of the curve. Or if the bond market is right and we're looking at a recession and deflationary environment, then you're also looking at higher rates, at least in the short term. So bonds are definitely looking tricky this year, even though many said the opposite."
"It's going to be very tricky for fixed cash flows, which means that bond signals in general remain short on the technical side, even though the fundamental side, many people are starting to get interested"
"I mean, I'll be honest, January was a period where we saw consolidation. People thought yields were not going to go higher. And it's really about balancing the long term and short term views. And what we've seen is longer term views are saying we're in a secular move towards higher rates and we're not there yet. I think the equity market also likes to be quick to say that things are over. So I think it's really about balancing multiple perspectives and seeing things over time as opposed to reacting too quickly."
"In some respect, what policymakers did during the pandemic has turned out to be a disaster. I think that what they were thinking was they were looking back on the past ten years and saw very little relationship between unemployment and inflation. They saw as a result of the big increase in monetary balances coming out of the GFC, really no inflation. And they thought they could effectively repeat that experiment. And it's been proven to be wrong. I think it was wrong this time around because it wasn't just a monetary experiment, it was a monetary experiment combined with a fiscal experiment. In other words, excessive fiscal spending, not just in the western world, but across the developed markets and the emerging markets. At the same time, expansive monetary policy in the emerging markets and the developed markets. So we have a global inflation problem as a result of this."
"There are really two ways, to stop inflation. One of them is to tighten monetary policy. But the other way, interestingly enough, is actually to let the inflation happen because when you do that, real monetary balances start to shrink. And when real monetary balances shrink, the consumer feels squeezed. And you can see that in the US data. If you look at real monetary balances measured by commercial deposits, bank deposits, commercial banks in the US. They're almost back to their trend level. Part of that is the quantitative tightening that we've seen over the last few months. But most of that is the inflation that's already happened. In other words, by virtue of having inflation, you eventually slow down and reduce the real balances and the consumer feels squeezed. One of the reasons why I think that we're going to see a resumption of the trend in disinflation in the US is for that very reason."
"I have to admit that post the GFC, I might have been one of those who thought that money was no longer important. Might have abandoned the old monetarist view coming out of the University of Chicago because the data simply didn't support it. The correlations didn't support it, the trends didn't support it. But now we see a resumption of validity in the monetarist's story that money does matter. And we probably got to a point where those real monetary balances in the US got to about 20% above the trend line. Well, guess what? Back of the envelope, that would imply that we're going to see a 20% increase in prices over and above the trend line for CPI. It's not so far from where we've gotten to, right? But again, the good news is that it's being unwound here certainly. Not in other places, but in the US."
"You can say that by virtue of quantitative tightening, we're going to see the central banks no longer buying bonds and potentially even selling their bonds. But that's running up against another problem, which is the problem of a slowing economy and I'm not exactly sure which is going to dominate, but I think for the next three to six months we're probably going to see lower yields in the US. Not higher yields. I know this is not necessarily the vogue thing to say right now, the ten year yield just reached a cyclical high of 4.1 yesterday. But keep in mind, my view is that we're going to see a slowdown in the US economy in the next few months, and it will be significant. I think in many sectors, we're already seeing it. Technology is certainly in a recessionary environment right now. All new economy sectors are, finance potentially as well. Housing certainly. So that's going to broaden, and I think we're looking at peak ten year yields right now. I think they're going to start heading down over the next three to six months. Not by a lot, mind you."
"You could see higher yields in Europe still because they've been late to addressing the inflation issue, and inflation is higher there. On top of that, and I would make even a case that the esoteric truth out there is that the European economy is actually stronger than the US economy right now. Look at the PMIs this morning on the services side. Remember, Europe is coming out of its funk that it experienced in Q4 by virtue of, of the winter emergency. It has China backing it up all of a sudden with its stimulus. It's very possible that the European economy is doing a little bit better than the US right now in terms of growth. And that all supports higher yields in the euro area versus the US. At least on a relative basis."
"Three month Libor at 5% signals short rates are going to keep going higher, that the Fed at a minimum is going to be higher for longer. The aggressive call right now is that they're going to move maybe 75 or another 100 basis points. We could be talking about a six handle before the end of the year on the funds rate. But short rates are going to keep going up. And that, I think, is the big driver of why the yield curve has become a new record inversion. Because it's all been driven by the long end. When the ten year rallies, we get record inversions. When the ten year rises in yields, we get some flattening of the yield curve, maybe less inversion of the yield curve. And I think that that story is going to continue with the bond market."
"But the arc of data that we've seen over the last several months has not been weak. It has not been what Elizabeth Warren, a Senator from Massachusetts, been calling millions of people losing their jobs. It hasn't happened. Maybe it does, but it hasn't happened yet. So I think he's probably going to stay with the more aggressive move that the Fed is going to continue to go at least two or three more rate hikes. And if you're right, if the payroll data is strong or if the CPI data is strong, that we'll be talking about 50 for the March meeting right now, the market is putting about a 30% chance that the Fed will go 50 basis points at the March meeting."
"A yield curve inversion is a forward indicator of recession, but more inversion does not mean a faster or harder recession than less inversion. It's a binary thing. Once you go inverted, you should be looking for a recession. Now, the thing about the yield curve is it can lead as much as 18 months before you eventually have that recession that would put you in the first or second quarter of next year. And I think that the whole narrative around the recession that a lot of people don't have that kind of patience. They think that the slowdown is going to happen in the next couple of months as opposed to an early 24 story. So yes, the yield curve is a very powerful signal that we might be seeing a very big slowdown in the economy. But just because it's inverting more does not mean it's going to be worse and it could still be up to a year away."
"I think that if there is a position that is very crowded in the bond market, it's definitely higher short rates, that you've seen a lot of speculative positions and a lot of people lining up to basically make a bet that short term interest rates, the two year note, the Libor, the Fed Funds rate or whatever is going to continue to go higher. Now, the thing about those kind of overcrowded trades is those are less market driven and more Federal Reserve policy driven type of trades."
"Other than that, if you want to look for crowded trades, I'd have to meander outside of interest rates and maybe say the reopening in China is probably on my radar as being the biggest crowded trade that we're seeing right now. Everybody's in on that trade, and with the idea that they're only pushing 5% growth for this year was a bit of a disappointment for that trade. This whole idea that it's going to be rip warring in China, that they are going to produce a ton of stuff, put it on cargo ships, send it to the US and collapse goods inflation in the US. I think that trade is a little bit overdone right now, and there's really no evidence that any of that is going to come to pass."
"When you look at the data that's come out so far this year, whether you look at the hard data being the jobs numbers, whether you look at the survey data for February was very robust. This is clearly an economy that's proving to be more resilient than a lot of people expected. And I'm not sure that that disinflation the market was really grabbing onto at the start of the year is necessarily going to come through, particularly when you look at where job growth has been most robust, where wage growth has been most robust. It's in leisure and hospitality. It's in the service sector more broadly. And the reality is that services are not really showing any signs."
"So I think the first point that we've been trying to make to people is that a lot of folks are suffering from recency bias, right? When they start to get agitated, they immediately think about one of two things. They either think about 2020 or they think about 2008. Statistically, those are very much outliers. And so when we look at the fundamental data, when we look at say, the cyclical sectors of the economy, we don't really see anything that is so far off sides that it suggests an outsized downturn when one does materialize. And so I think what we've been trying to lean on is, look, this economy has more momentum and yes, that has implications for inflation. But if the Fed decides to crash the ship at some point down the road, we don't really see the pieces in place the way that they were, say in 07-08 with respect to housing, and certainly don't foresee another global pandemic coming any time."
"At the end of the day, this is really an exercise in central banks and the Fed in particular defending their credibility. I mean, the Fed can get inflation to wherever they want it to be. They can get growth to wherever they want it to be. The question is what needs to happen to rates? And more specifically, what is the terminal rate actually look like? If this is a more inflationary economy, what that means is that R-star isn't two and a half percent, it's probably somewhere higher. And that has implications for what the Fed needs to do in order to snuff this inflation candle out. And so to me, the worst case scenario is a Fed that gets very frustrated with their inability, seeming inability to get inflation back into check. And they keep hiking and hiking and hiking and throw that whole theory about leads and lags and it takes time for this to work its way through the economy very much into the wind. That's the big risk to the economy this year."
"I think economic resilience is good for stocks short term. And I think that a lot of the concerns about profits are going to collapse by 30% that we've talked about together over the past couple of months. That's not necessarily going to come to fruition if the economy is still humming along and inflation is taking longer to come down. So I do think that near term there is an opportunity in risk and risk could certainly end up performing well again in the short run. I think that the challenge is how do you get inflation back in the bottle? Well, you reduce demand. And at some point that shows up in corporate revenues and corporate profits. And when earnings begin to really fall apart, that to me is what's going to lead the market back down, not necessarily to a new low, but perhaps the levels that we saw back in October and June of last year."
"So I think that earnings estimates are coming back down to earth, and I think that that's a good thing. The 2023 number is down call it 7-8% so far, year to date. The challenge is when you think about what the market price is off of, the market price is off of a forward multiple. The forward multiple is about 17 and a half, 18 times today. We think that's about two turns expensive relative where it should be. And furthermore, it's really a question about 2024 earnings because everybody was talking about how this was going to be a year where profits came under pressure. But if the economy is proving to be more resilient, that story is getting shifted down the road. And I'm not sure that markets necessarily appreciate that and I certainly don't think that it's in the price."
"Tech is not necessarily worth the premium off 17 and 18 times. The reason why is that when we look around the markets today, there are plenty of other interesting things to do."
"I think my base case assumption is that there's going to be some sort of cost of capital in the market going forward, and that's going to make equities less about one thing, ie mega cap or long duration growth and a bit more balanced like we saw in the past. I actually think businesses that can generate productivity are going to be the ones that perform best in this environment because investors aren't going to reward earnings growth simply as a function of rising prices, right? They want to see business plans changing and that's going to make or break investments going."
"Euro banks performing, part of it is the sigh of relief trade. I mean, it's been, what, a decade since the eurozone crisis? And Europe finally seems to be kind of shaking off its scabs and coming back into the limelight. I think part of it might be a very long overdue deadcat bounce. I also think generally there's an expectation getting baked into that market that the ECB is going to have to do more. And like the Fed, when the ECB pauses, it's going to be a pause. They're not going to turn around and cut. Generally speaking, that's just a healthier environment for the banks. And furthermore, the European banks are very different today than they were in 07-08. Seeing much better behavior is the way I would categorize it."
"China and 5% could drive oil up $10 a barrel. I think what we're seeing with China is that consumer demand is returning. Industrial demand is not returning as quickly. And so we're still in this kind of slower climb up. I remember when they started the reopening and everyone was anticipating this huge surge in oil demand. I said, well, I don't know if it's going to happen quite as fast as we saw in the Western economies. I think it's going to be more of a slow climb up. And the question is, really, when is that going to start going to start hitting? And it does seem like now the consensus is not till H2. And that's when we're going to see $100 oil, potentially. Of course, that hits right in the middle of the summer and potentially very high temperatures and lots of driving demand, especially in the US. Of course, that hits right in the middle of the summer and potentially very high temperatures and lots of driving demand, especially in the US. So I do think that that's really more of where we're looking at in terms of a surge in oil prices and of course, everyone who's predicted high oil prices. We've seen oil jump up and then go back down on recessionary fears. So I do think we're headed more in an upward trend, but there's always that potential for things to kind of wobble."
"I remember at the end of 2022, we kept seeing these incredible predictions. Oil is going to be $120 and $130 in 2023, and now we're seeing revisions down to, well, maybe we might hit $100 a barrel. I do think that we are headed, in general, towards a period of tightness of supply being more of a concern. I do think that there is potential in certain areas to increase supply to meet that demand, that the place is not necessarily the United States, though I don't think we can depend on US producers to ramp up production as much as we have in the past. And that is something that is not necessarily being reflected in the forecast we're seeing from, say, the EIA. I do think Saudi Arabia and UAE have potential. There's also potential from Iraq. And I do think that if things get really tight, we will see OPEC moving to increase their quotas, but maybe not really until June, July or even August."
"Definitely, we're seeing more people buy electric vehicles, but I don't think that these are a main driver in oil stockpiles because electric vehicles are still limited in their range. And when you look at big driving, I mean, it's not people driving an electric vehicle 20 miles to do some errands around town. So I really don't think we're seeing that bite. I think if you really want to look at the big drivers in demand, we're talking about China and India, and these are not places where electric vehicles are necessarily having a huge impact. But for every EV that sold how many internal combustion engine cars are still on the road and still being driven. So I don't think that that is cutting demand in the places where demand is really increasing all that much."
