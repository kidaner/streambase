"Well, we did call that bottom in October, and we thought it would be a substantial rally. 15, 20%, we got that rally, and then we decided, well, the risk reward is no longer attractive. And so we backed off of that and we said we'd probably go down and retest those lows at a minimum and probably take it out, which is really based on our fundamental view that the earnings recession is now in place. People acknowledge that, but I think there's a very wide range of how deep that earnings recession is going to be with us kind of on the deeper end of that range. Now, this past weekend, we looked at the chart. We have to be objective about what we see. We're technicians in addition to fundamental strategists. And we looked at the price action last week, and we actually talked about it in the week, the week before. We said, look, we're going to probably test this level. If it holds, it'll be a constructive marker, at least in the short term, and that's how we're viewing it. I don't think it changes our intermediate term view that the risk reward is still pretty lousy at 4100 because of that earnings recession view that we have on the fundamental side."
"October we were trading 3500. Valuations were 15, 20% lower, interest rates, you know, were higher, we felt like they were going to come down. So we had a lot of catalysts, China reopening. There were a lot of reasons to believe that that was a very tradable low, not just for trader types, but for people who were running real capital. And it turned out to be the case. One thing I will say to you all, however, is that we're pretty confident that between now and the next earning season, which isn't that far away, that will be when we think the next fair market kind of decline happens. Maybe like a more meaningful decline, 10% plus."
The economic data has been better. China's reopening is kind of just getting going and they've kind of held back. They could gather some steam. I think people came into this year feeling as if the recession was inevitable and that no longer is the case. It's probably 30-40% chance and that can keep animal spirits alive.
"We've talked about the liquidity picture from outside the US. So the Feds doing their job, trying to tighten financial conditions. The problem for them is that we have the bank of Japan and we have the PBOC adding liquidity, and you have a dollar that's kind of softening up, which is kind of neutralizing the Fed's goals of tightening financial conditions, and that's also kind of breathed some life into risk assets."
"Ultimately, we think valuations and the fundamentals meaning earnings, will determine where stock prices trade. That set up is not particularly great, particularly to move higher in rates this year."
"For the asset owner crowd, we've been pretty adamant. We felt like the fall was a really good entry point where people had a longer time horizon, and if you added risk there, you probably just stay with it. The rally in the fall was based on, we think, fundamentals, meaning rates coming down, economic data getting better because of China, globally at least, and that would help the kind of cyclical type areas of the market."
"I do think people that are getting a bit carried away on what they've been buying. We had this more speculative rally that started in January, kind of buying last year's losers, which was all the growth stocks and the meme stocks, and those have just gotten out of control again, particularly in the context of higher rates."
"If you have kind of names that you want to own, if you want to underwrite through what we think is going to be a difficult time for earnings, and you say, look, I think there's value in this security for the next three years, great. You should just own those through that period."
"However, there's a lot of stuff that's gotten dragged along here that is wildly speculative. Now, in my viewing, it's actually somewhat reckless. And that's the stuff that you got to be really careful, it's in your portfolio, got to get out of it, because that stuff has gotten revalued in a way that doesn't make much sense to us. I think there's plenty of stocks that are probably going to go bankrupt. Then I would say but overall, the growth of your stuff and even the cyclical names have gone too far now, could have as much as 20% downside. Our valuation work would suggest that even without the earnings recession right. The valuations are kind of out of bounds again."
It's a stock picking market with not a great macro backdrop. So that's the challenge.
"The bottom line is, when you get a normal interest rate structure, all of a sudden down the income statement matters. I think it's a forgotten metric, which is that your costs sit on your balance sheet until they have to hit the income statement."
"We live in this world now where there's sort of almost like hand to mouth guidance, the Fed doing it for the bond market and companies doing it for the stock market. And so it's a process that takes longer than it probably should. And that's what's frustrating, I think, for some investors who are in the weeds on this to where we are. It's like, well, my goodness, it's pretty obvious what's about to happen. Why is the market taking so long to kind of price this? That's just the way it is. That's kind of the way it always is at this stage when you get a significant earnings recession, it just takes longer than you would think to get it priced."
"The recovery itself was sort of two stage…it was goods first, then services. Normally in a normal recovery, everything comes back at the same time. So you have this sort of rolling recovery and now rolling recession. Tech is in a recession right now, they're losing negative growth. They're laying people off more aggressive in other sectors. And I think the big question for the economy is, does that spill over into the services sector, which is where the employment really lives? That's small, medium businesses and services companies employ a lot more people."
"Services will probably get hit later in the year when other businesses are showing weakness and then we're seeing layoffs there, which then people spend less money."
"This idea of operational efficiency is what the market is paying for. Companies that are showing good inventory controls, labor costs as a percentage of cost of goods sold are smaller, and then capex depreciation is lower. We think the market will continue to pay for companies that are very efficient with their expenses and can get the revenue to the bottom line."
"We do think that a lot of the goods sector stocks in particular, and even the earnings forecast have come down because it's obvious, right, we had a pull forward of demand and so those numbers have been reset."
"Calling a recession is very hard because you never know when that light switch is going to go off unemployment, but when it does, it's immediate and there's no lead time. It's just all sudden, it hits you with the earnings picture."
"I think that a 50 basis point hike is actually inflammatory or would raise a lot of concerns among markets and also consumers and businesses that the Fed is losing control over inflation, at least the fight over inflation. So I think the Fed is probably going to opt for more 25 basis point hikes, probably three more, maybe even more, greater than that. Maybe we'll get to something close to 6%. It's not really clear, but it's really going to depend upon inflation and also the labor market and whether wages are starting to cool at all."
"It's interesting, consumers are divided in terms of the present situation. They're saying we're fine. Most of us are working. Many of us who switch jobs are seeing wage increases. We may still have a little bit of spending, a little bit of savings that we can spend. We have credit cards and we're continuing to spend. However, looking at the future, they still say, hey, we do expect a recession at some point. We're concerned about job prospects, we're concerned about the business environment, and we're concerned about our own income. So it's really a mixed picture in terms of how consumers are feeling."
"In the last reading, folks making between $35-75k were the most concerned about the outlook. And indeed, when we look at what consumers are saying they're going to do regarding spending, they're saying they're not going to buy cars or homes and they're even pulling back on expectations for going on vacation. And that's really important because that's a harbinger of what's going to happen in the services sector."
"Consumers certainly did spend a lot of money in January. They were pulling back on consumption late last year. But then there was a big spurt. And really the last shoe to fall is going to be the consumer, especially with respect to purchasing."
"Our leading indicators continue to signal recession. Indeed, they say that recession should be happening right about now. But consumers are defying all expectations."
But certainly when we look at business investment that's already starting to roll over and certainly investment in capex structures and the residential investment environment are all weakening.
"But I think that the reality is the ECB have still got the inflation problem to deal with. So everyone over here is well aware that core inflation is coming down, albeit albeit slower than the Fed would like it to be. That's not the case in Europe. Core inflation continues to move higher in Europe. So the ECB, who were behind the curve, who were slower to the party of rate hiking than other central banks, is playing catch up and it feels like they're going to have to have to go a little bit harder"
"I think Europe has there were big concerns about Europe last summer, the gas problems and the hikes. I mean, the Bundesbank I think at one point was saying Germany could fall 5% GDP and obviously that hasn't transpired. And now you've got an environment when Europe's coming out the other side. The gas tanks are much fuller than was expected come the end of the winter. And people are seeing a really good cycle out of Europe. And again, that goes into the problem the ECB has got to deal with. They've got the growth, but they've also got the inflation and they're going to have to keep going, coming out of the pandemic."
"Obviously we saw a big correlation last year. Last year it was across fixed income, across equities, everything was going down in price. And I think we are going to see a bit of a difference this year because of the huge repricing that we saw last year in fixed income. And then you've got, as I say, some central banks which are much further ahead."
"I think we're going to have a slower journey or a more smoother journey than we saw last year outside of the European Central Bank. I think the central banks want to slow down the pace of hiking, which is going to bring down market volatility, and then it's going to be a case of later in the year, how high do rates get and then do we have to do some sharp decreases if we do start to see a slowdown."
"We did see that concern around spread risk in Europe last year, last summer, when we had these big concerns around a slowdown. And as we've come through that and the slowdown hasn't materialized and economic growth and strength looks better in Europe, people are getting a bit more confidence around Europe. And we've seen that not just in peripheries, we've seen that in credit spreads, high yield spreads, they've basically come back down to pretty much be in line with where the US is trading."
"But I think you've also got a much more joined up Europe than I can really ever remember with the recovery plan in place and the coordination that we've seen across Europe. So it feels that we haven't got that sort of spread risk, the periphery risk that we've seen through previous cycles and that we've all come to know over the last decade or so. And if that goes away, then actually there's some decent yields on offer owning some of these bonds."
"So if you think about what's been the case of Europe over the last decade, negatively yielding bonds, who wanted to invest in Europe, who wanted to buy negatively yielding bonds? Well, that's not the case at the moment. Two year Germany now at 3%, you're getting north of 4% across the Italian curve. You're getting seven, seven and a half percent across the European high yield mix. And that's before you even move into into the dangerous world of equities. So I think there's just a lot of demand that will come back into into fixed income. People who haven't wanted to own European fixed income for a long time."
So we're still playing for the curve to actually flatten a bit further from here. We think there is still concerns that the central banks around the world maybe have to do a little bit more that's priced. Although the repricing that we've seen over the last few weeks has been very helpful. And then really it's the back end of the curve that gives you that ballast in a portfolio. That's the bit of the curve that will do very well if things go badly and suddenly fixed income yields move higher and the capital gains could come from that part of the can.
"So I think obviously then, you've got to take into account that's obviously the European curve where there must possibly more still going through from an ECB standpoint, I think in the US. And that means that over the next few years that looks like a decent investment. And I think buying bonds definitely more attractive than they were at any point last year. And thankfully, the rally that happened in January has reversed a bit to give us another opportunity to go back into the market."
"To me, there's two EMs at the minimum, the frontier economies greatly beleaguered, and another EM of great prosperity. I think EM is extremely diversified right now, and you hit the nail on the head in terms of bifurcating the frontier economies, especially the low single B high yield economies that are facing a lot of stress. Some of them have very large external financing needs. They're having to have IMF programs or other bilateral lines from creditors like the Gulf states and China. And then there is the rest of EM. There is the investment grade portion and the double B portion of the EM asset class. Even there, there is a lot of diversification and differentiation, both in terms of the balance sheet as well as how these economies are coming out of this COVID and growth cycle."
"Unfortunately, I don't think EM is a one size fits all in terms of the framework or model that you need to use. And so really, thinking about asset classes and regions makes a lot of sense right now, as well as countries that perhaps are going to benefit more secularly from the near shoring and structural shifts that are occurring both in the global and macro playing field for EM."
"I think the main investment implication from this is to really think about EM in terms of the various centers of global growth and drivers of global growth. For EM as a whole, this fractionalization that we're seeing much more of from the US and China, trade relations and geopolitics is really going to be a headwind for many countries within the asset class. Slow globalization, as the IMF has coined the term, is not a positive for the EM asset class as a whole. Having said that, there are areas that are going to be growing and perhaps benefiting from this. Countries like Mexico, countries like India, many other smaller emerging markets that perhaps have a niche in particular parts of the supply chain. And so for the EM asset class, I think the investment implication really is to start from the bottom up and really focus on country by country selection in terms of really thinking about the investment opportunities that are out there."
"Well, I think that looking at the fixed income opportunities in China with the cyclical horizon, we are a bit more cautious given the opportunities elsewhere within the fixed income world as well as within emerging markets. So if you're looking at the level of real rates, really you're getting better opportunities elsewhere, whether it's Brazil or even Mexico. If you're looking at currency plays, perhaps the CNY is not the best play right now, given with outbound tourism. You may see capital outflows resuming. So I think that from an investment perspective, there are more interesting opportunities from a risk adjusted perspective elsewhere within EM."
