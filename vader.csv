"But the main takeaway for me is, yes, we could talk about terminal rate estimates and the pace of hikes, but what I'm hearing is just more data dependence. And myopic data dependence can always be dangerous, but is particularly problematic in an environment where we have weather distortions, seasonal adjustment distortions, low survey responses. We are in data that is really having trouble sending us a clear signal, at least over the long term. And I'm concerned that we're going to see markets that are overreacting to data points that have false decision, and potentially even a central bank that's moving too quickly and making big policy changes, even via communication off of data that I think is going to be very bumpy in the next three to six months."
"I think the Fed may not be focused on specifically some of those traditional inflation measures, but that rise we've seen in inflation expectations and market based measures, that's what's keeping me up at night. That is moving in the wrong direction now. It's countered by inflation expectations among consumers that are still going lower. And I'm hoping that the Fed is focusing on those long term inflation expectations, which are coming down quite a bit. Exactly. One of my bigger concerns is this summer we're probably going to lose some of the disinflation momentum that's largely going to be base effects. So this downward momentum that we've seen is probably going to stall. That's when we're going to start hearing those words like stagflation come back. And if we haven't seen some slowdown in jobs by then, a Fed that's going to stay hawkish through the summer"
"The only way we're going to walk back this pricing for the March meeting is what we see in the jobs data in the next few days. And when I say jobs data, I mean we've got jobless claims, we've got job openings, we've got Challenger, ADP, NFP. It's a veritable buffet of jobs data that's going to be coming through, and no one number is going to be, I think, more important than the sum of those stories, especially in an environment where we're really trying to dig deeper. We got to look at private sector jobs data right now, people looking at job postings on things like LinkedIn and Indeed, if you want to understand what the Fed is going to be doing a year or two years from now, which I think is even more important than the March meeting, you got to be looking at all of the data available and really making sure that you understand the comprehensive story behind it."
"But there is a lot of short termism in this industry and financial media, when you're an economist, you're always looking for what is the next big story, and I don't want to miss that inflection point. But problematically, we have a lot of data that's moving two steps forward, one steps back, and it's getting dangerous to extrapolate too far in the future. We have portfolios that are trading tactically, and they need to be moving off of that. But if you're a longer term investor, a lot of this is noise that's distracting from the signal. You need to be focusing twelve to 18 months, or even in some cases, we have to produce five year forecasts to tell us where our strategic portfolio should be positioned over the very long term. And so some of this focus on the Fed moving back and forth in a month to month basis. It's not valuable to investors, and sometimes it can actually be distracting, in some cases even dangerous."
"I'm not sure the market is getting the economy wrong, again, it depends on your time frame. So Q1 is certainly much stronger than many people expected. That consumer is holding in strong. But the challenge comes back to and I've heard a lot of your guests talk about this, where are we going to be down the road? And it is very difficult to discount the probability of a recession twelve to 18 months from now. So if we're talking about the next three months, sure, there's no problem in saying this economy is stronger than we expected in November and December. But if you want to argue for no recession, you have to discount almost every single leading indicator that has very reliably predicted a recession later in the year or twelve to 18 months. You can try to do that. We have a very different labor market. We have excess savings, but from my view, it's a very hard sell. One thing you can say is that the leads and lags in this economy may be different than what we've previously expected, but I would just really focus on your timelines. Are you talking about the economy in the next three months solid, or are you talking about the 18 month outlook? I think a lot of strategists, including myself, need to work on really being clear about their timelines for their forecast"
"And I think that's actually the game is what does the economy look like twelve to 18 months from now? Actually, I'm concerned about that. I think it's going to look a little more stagflationary than we'd be comfortable with. I'm less concerned about a technical recession. We know the playbook to trade recessions. We know what those look like historically. I'm more concerned about 18 months from now. We've been in a very slow growth environment for a pretty extended period of time, and we have inflation stuck around 3% to 4%, and problematically inflation that's rested in the system that's still there is likely to be less interest rate sensitive than the inflation that we've managed to kind of dissipate over this period of time. So this word stagflation, there's lots of ways to define it. There's lots of ways people can talk about it. I think that's going to be more of a theme for us moving forward than we thought it was going to be even just a few months ago."
"So if you think about the way that Powell has been communicating about getting restrictive, right. There's three dimensions to that. There's the pace, there's the level, and then there's the duration. And what Powell has been doing for months now is saying, okay, we've hiked a lot and so don't worry about the pace so much. It's about the level that we get to and the duration at which we stay at that restrictive level. Yesterday, he essentially threw that out the window. That is confusing. And I think the key takeaway is that if we are going to consider reaccelerating to 50 based on the data and they are very data dependent, the risk of a hard landing does go up in that scenario and the yield curve is telling you as much what we saw yesterday twelve basis points higher on the two year flat on the ten year break evens narrower the yield curve twos tens getting to -100 that is the risk of overtightening that the bond market is picking up on. And that's also why you're seeing very sticky resistance on tens at 4%, which is something we've been watching and saying, yeah, people are interested at bonds even in this repricing. The yields are there and the diversification benefits are going to become even more important if the Fed is going towards that hard landing scenario."
"We think that we are getting to levels that are sufficiently restrictive. So last year the thing that I was always quoting was the real Fed funds rate. So saying that the Fed wasn't going to stop hiking until the real Fed funds rate turned positive. So essentially you needed the Fed funds rate to move above the level of inflation. We are making progress on that. If you look at core PCE, it's around 4.6%. The Fed is now expected to get to five, maybe five and a half. That's going to be a significantly positive real Fed funds rate."
"And I think we have to think about the way in which policy impacts the economy. It impacts housing first, then manufacturing, then consumer and labor and it's actually playing out in that traditional way. Housing, home prices have been deflating for six straight months. Business investment is starting to rolling over. Now what's only left is the consumer and the labor market. It just takes time."
"Well, I think that with the yield curve this inverted, you are looking at a rates market that is suggesting the risk of hard landing is rising. Now, where I think the discontinuity is is really more in the spread market. So in credit, so spreads are still on the narrow end of the recent ranges of history. So that's where I would say more of the complacency is. But I think in the rates market itself, I think you are seeing the risk of overtightening playing through within the very inverted yield curve."
"So we do think that we're in a new regime and the starting point of that new regime was the fact that this is the first hiking cycle in 30 years that the peak of that hiking cycle is higher than the prior one. Right. So we were having higher or lower highs and lower lows for 30 years. That's the bull market of fixed income. We are now going in the opposite direction. So this is a meaningful shift because the next time that the Fed cuts, we don't think it's going to be back to the zero lower bound. So there is some changes that are happening here, but those are slow moving. There are still going to be cyclical shifts in yields throughout our broader structural view that we could be entering into a phase of higher highs and higher lows."
"We think that inflation structurally is not necessarily going to struggle as much to get to that 2% level. So if you think about pre COVID, but post GFC, it was very hard for the Fed to achieve 2% core PCE. In fact, on average, it was about one and a half percent. So we were missing it to the downside by about 50 basis points all the time. Now I think you can say maybe things have started to shift because of deglobalization, because of other factors, that it will be easier for the Fed to get to that 2%. We're not suggesting a materially higher regime for inflation and rates, but it is one that is shifting over time.\"
So I think the strength of the move in twos yesterday clearly shows that some people were offsides and there are positions that needed to be cleaned out.
"Look, I think I think what Powell did yesterday was the right thing to do. The data has been hot and if he didn't put 50 on the table, it then threatens a further loosening of financial conditions which will unanchor inflation expectations. So he had to put it on the table. I actually think it was the right thing to do. But now the problem is he's locked in because if they don't go 50 right, it's been a series of locking in. The Fed talks too much. I have thought that throughout this whole cycle there's too much talking, too much talk of disinflation eight weeks ago, 13 times. But in the end, by putting 50 on the table in the near term, they're almost forced to go through it. I think a 200 number on Friday would do it."
"Resiliency of stocks is confounding and the question of the year. And to your point, why was Nasdaq leading yesterday? So let's just point out that even after the price action yesterday, stocks were where they were on Thursday. And the disconnect between the bond volatility and what's happening in the stock market is ever widening. This year to date, in 2023, the market has been remarkably resilient, as have credit spreads, as you've just talked about, which is what's holding up the market here. So I think what the market is seeing is that ultimately that 10-year having a hard time over 4% and ultimately the 10-year is going to move lower because a slowdown will be coming. The Fed is going to wind up pushing us into recession."
"So I do buy the thought that the economy appears to be less sensitive to rate hikes than originally thought. I mean, we are now at 4.50-4.75 in twelve months. With the crisis, with the great knock on effect, we're nowhere. Okay? And I think that surprised a lot of us who've seen other rate cycles here. So that has to do with the fact that most of mortgages are fixed rate at 3%, people are making the spread on a 5% six month treasury. Right? So they're actually making money on this trade. But even if the economy is less resilient, the Fed will probably have to go higher and will eventually work. It's just going to take longer. The data and the real economy continues to be fairly strong. You're seeing weakening in certain parts of the economy, such as housing. Clearly commercial real estate is at risk. That's flashing a warning sign here. But that's really the beginning of it. It just hasn't happened yet. As long as labor is strong and as long as workers are getting wage increases, which they are, you can keep this going further."
"So far, cyclicals this year have worked, as have growth, right? And I think that begins to change a little bit. You have to think of this as if the Fed has to go to 6% or even higher. It's not our base case, but you have to start opening your mind to the fact that it could happen. Then you start having to see a recession by the end of the year or even into 2024. The confounding part of this year is that the recession hasn't happened yet. And it's very hard to predict with the strength we see in other sectors, such as the service sector, which continues to hold up the economy. But you have to expect it within, let's say, the next twelve months. And with that you do start asking the question, will cyclicals continue to outperform? And that's really where you have to go with this because the defensive stocks have been terrible this year, right? Health care has been tough, staples have been tough, utilities have been tough and the cyclicals have ripped. So the question is what happens if the recession really starts to be priced in?"
"I think what's unspoken in this conversation today is the debt ceiling. That could change what the Fed does rather remarkably and rather quickly as well. And the fact that the US. Hasn't had a recession in the third year of a presidential term because it's an election cycle coming up. What happens to the pressure on Powell if we actually get that recession by the end of the year? Can he finish the job? I don't think Powell is Burns yet. The question is, will he be Burns in the future? I think for now, Powell's sticking to the Volcker playbook, and I think he's doing a pretty good job at it. The question is, if we get that recession, if your unemployment rate goes to 3.8% from here, which doesn't feel like a lot, he'll be getting pressure from the right and the left. "
"Well, I thought he finally stepped into where we knew the Fed was. And the fact that all the headlines actually reported the same chairman, Jay Powell, is really important. And that is they are data dependent. The data and the narrative has shifted. And that does put a half percent on the table. Now, could it change? There's two more key data points coming out before they meet on March 21. But I think it's important that he laid out just how data dependent they are and the willingness to pivot. You got another Powell pivot, and that is that we could get a half percent at this next meeting and that rates are going higher, faster. I think that's very important information to have. It's one that we've been arguing and yes, the data has been out there officially since the Valentine's Day massacre of that inflation number we came out. But the revisions to that were out prior to that, the Friday before it, and we were looking at it going, oh my gosh, this has changed the entire narrative."
"We certainly could see some cooling, and I think we are seeing some cooling. And I think the ADP data is now the way that they've redone it. And I give a lot of credit to Nela Richardson over at ADP for not making it a forecast of the official payrolls data. It is its own data set, but it still shows that there is a lot of strength in wage gains there. That's terrific for wage earners. But to the extent that we're seeing continued upward pressure on inflation tied to demand, which is tied to the wages people earn, that is a concern for the Fed. And I think that data we know the month of January. Part of the reason ADP's report was so weak was because it is more sensitive to the floods we saw in California. So people who didn't work the whole week didn't show up as much on payrolls in that week. That was the survey week. It was not the same for the national data. If they got paid even a dime that week, they showed up on national payrolls. So I do think we'll see some downside surprises as well as we come off this unseasonably hot January in many ways. But the bottom line is you need the threshold to get us to the Fed feeling like it's actually got inflation under control, and then inflation will not become a more entrenched. Inflation is very, very high. That means their threshold to slow down rate hikes is high right now. "
